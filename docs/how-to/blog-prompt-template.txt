- date: The publication date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
- excerpt: A brief summary of the post (1-2 sentences).
- category: The main category of the post (e.g., 'AI in Manufacturing').
- tags: A YAML list of relevant keywords (e.g., ['AI', 'Decision Making']).

manually later.)
- slug: A URL-friendly slug for the post (e.g., 'your-blog-post-title-here').

For any sections that visually resemble a 'highlight' or 'blockquote' in the original content, format them in Markdown as:
> [HIGHLIGHT]
> Your highlight content here.

For any sections that describe a 'feature' with an associated icon, format the heading as a standard Markdown heading, and if an icon is implied, describe it in parentheses at the end of the heading. For example:
### Your Feature Title (e.g., ChatGPT Data Analysis)

Ensure all other content (headings, paragraphs, lists, bold/italic text, links, etc.) is converted using standard Markdown syntax.
