This is an initial placeholder for the Fae Intelligence Blueprint document.

## **Internal Tools & Dashboards**

This section outlines the internal tools and dashboards integrated into the Fae Intelligence Hub for operational and administrative purposes. These tools are accessible only to authorized administrators via Firebase Authentication.

### **Consultancy Dashboard**

*   **Purpose:** Provides a strategic overview of consultancy phases, key activities, and monitoring tips. It's used for planning and tracking long-term consultancy engagements.
*   **Access:** Available at `/admin/dashboard` (requires login).
*   **Data Source:** Utilizes a statically defined dataset (`blueprintData.ts`) representing the core consultancy blueprint.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Visual blueprint of consultancy phases.
    *   Detailed activity tracking with status, priority, and CRM details.
    *   Monitoring section for progress and tips.

### **Prompt Management System**

*   **Purpose:** A system for creating, organizing, tagging, and testing AI prompts, particularly for use with generative AI models.
*   **Access:** Available at `/admin/prompts` (requires login).
*   **Data Storage:** Prompts are stored and managed in a Firestore collection ('prompts').
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Create, edit, and delete prompts with detailed attributes.
    *   Tagging and filtering capabilities for easy retrieval.
    *   Direct interaction with Gemini API (or similar) for testing prompts (future enhancement).

### **Workflow Documentation Generator**

*   **Key Features:**
    *   Define workflow steps, including tools used, inputs/outputs, and human actions.
    *   Link steps to specific prompts via their IDs.
    *   Visualize workflows as a sequence of connected nodes.
    *   Export workflow documentation to PDF.
