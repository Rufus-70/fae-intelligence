Okay, let's proceed with outlining the next module in Workshop 6. We've just completed a detailed breakdown of Module 3 across all levels, so let's move on to Module 4: Introduction to Server-Based AI Solutions.
Remember, we are designing this workshop with three levels:
Level 1: Foundations (Beginner-Friendly)
Level 2: Implementation (Intermediate)
Level 3: Integration & Advanced AI (Advanced)
Here's the breakdown for Module 4 across these three levels:
Module 4: Introduction to Server-Based AI Solutions (Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes)

Explore the benefits of hosting AI models and knowledge bases on a dedicated server (scalability, security, control).
Learn the basics of deploying and managing server-based AI solutions.

Level 1: Foundations (Beginner-Friendly)
Focus: High-level overview of server-based AI, its advantages, and common use cases. Analogies and simplified explanations will be used to convey the core concepts.
Learning Objectives:
Define what a server is in simple terms.
Explain why AI applications and knowledge bases often need to be hosted on servers.
Identify the key benefits of server-based AI solutions (e.g., accessibility, reliability).
Recognize common examples of server-based AI in everyday applications.

Materials Needed:
Laptop with internet access
Workshop Handout (Level 1 version) - including a glossary of key terms

Sub-Modules & Execution Steps:
Sub-Module 4.1: What is a Server? (Duration: 30 minutes - Level 1)
Execution Steps:
Exercise 4.1.1: The Analogy Approach:
Objective: Understand the concept of a server using everyday analogies.
Steps:
Start with a discussion: "Think about a website like Google or Amazon. Where do you think all the information and software that makes those websites work are stored?"
Introduce the analogy: "A server is like a powerful, always-on computer that stores information and provides services to other computers and devices."
Use examples: "Think of it like a library that's open 24/7, or a restaurant kitchen that's constantly preparing meals."
Avoid technical jargon: "Don't worry about the technical details for now; just understand that a server is a central place where things are stored and processed."


Exercise 4.1.2: Server-Based Applications We Use Every Day:
Objective: Identify everyday applications that rely on servers.
Steps:
Brainstorm a list of online services (e.g., email, social media, online banking, streaming video).
Discuss: "Where do you think these services keep all your emails, photos, videos, and account information?"
Explain that all these services rely on servers to store and deliver their content.


Trainer Notes: Keep explanations simple and use relatable examples.

Sub-Module 4.2: Why Server-Based AI? (Duration: 30 minutes - Level 1)
Execution Steps:
Exercise 4.2.1: The Challenge of Scale:
Objective: Understand why AI applications often require servers due to their complexity and resource needs.
Steps:
Analogy: "Imagine you have a small chatbot running on your laptop. It can handle a few conversations at a time. But what if hundreds or thousands of people want to chat with it at the same time?"
Explain: "AI applications, especially those using large language models, require a lot of processing power and memory. Servers provide these resources."
Discuss: "If a company has a knowledge base accessed by many employees, it needs to be stored on a server to handle all the requests and ensure everyone can get the information they need quickly."


Exercise 4.2.2: Key Benefits of Server-Based AI (Simplified):
Objective: Identify the main advantages of using servers for AI solutions in non-technical terms.
Steps:
Present key benefits in simple language:
Accessibility: "Everyone can use the AI application or knowledge base from anywhere with an internet connection."
Reliability: "The AI system is always available and running smoothly."
Performance: "The AI system can handle many users and complex requests without slowing down."
Security: "Data is stored securely on the server and protected from unauthorized access."

Use relatable examples for each benefit: "Like how you can access your email from your phone, computer, or tablet because it's stored on a server."


Trainer Notes: Avoid technical details about server configurations or infrastructure. Focus on the end-user benefits.

Sub-Module 4.3: Common Examples of Server-Based AI (Duration: 30 minutes - Level 1)
Execution Steps:
Exercise 4.3.1: Identifying AI in Cloud Applications:
Objective: Recognize how AI features in familiar cloud applications rely on server infrastructure.
Steps:
List common cloud-based applications that use AI: "Think about applications you use every day, like email spam filtering, translation tools, or voice assistants."
Discuss: "How do you think these applications are able to offer these AI features?"
Explain that these applications use server-based AI models to provide their functionality.
Provide examples: "For instance, when you use a translation tool, the translation happens on a server running powerful AI models."


Exercise 4.3.2: The Knowledge Base Example:
Objective: Reinforce the concept of server-based AI in the context of knowledge bases.
Steps:
Reiterate: "Just like those cloud applications, AI-powered knowledge bases also need to be hosted on servers."
Discuss: "What if a large company had employees all over the world needing to access the same AI-powered knowledge base? How would they ensure everyone can access it quickly and reliably?"
Explain: "Using a server allows the company to make the knowledge base available to everyone, no matter where they are."



Trainer Notes: Keep the examples relevant and relatable to the participants' experiences.
