# "It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory." - W. Edwards Deming

This statement was never truer than it is today with artificial intelligence.

After 30 years in manufacturing operations—from medical devices to precision optics—I've witnessed every improvement methodology you can name. Six Sigma. Lean. Quality circles. Agile. Each brought real value and transformed our processes, but nothing has amplified individual team members' capabilities like artificial intelligence (AI) can.

Here's what got my attention: **these tools don't require million-dollar budgets or massive IT infrastructure overhauls.** We're talking about free or low-cost solutions that can deliver immediate operational improvements.

In my previous role, before a recent reduction in force, I watched our teams struggle with the same challenges I'd seen for decades: tribal knowledge walking out the door with retiring employees, quality issues requiring weeks of investigation, maintenance schedules built on gut instinct rather than data, and endless hours spent on tasks that could be automated.

The tools to address these challenges were right there—ChatGPT for process documentation, Google's Teachable Machine for visual quality control, Excel with AI functions for predictive maintenance insights. My team embraced them and saw real results.

Despite demonstrating these tools' potential and achieving success with my own team, I couldn't convince other departments and leadership to embrace them. The resistance was real—fear of complexity, concerns about job security, skepticism about "another technology fad," and the assumption that AI meant expensive, complex implementations.

Meanwhile, we have several RIF’s over the last year so resources kept shrinking. Fewer people. Tighter budgets. Higher expectations.

The companies embracing AI are getting ahead while the ones falling behind are forming committees to discuss how AI might be used someday, while their competitors who have already embraced these tools are flying ahead.

Committee don't close the competitive gap—practical implementation does.

**That's why Fae Intelligence exists.**

It three decades of operational leadership, I've never seen tools that can magnify a teammates effectiveness like today's AI. A quality engineer can now analyze defect patterns in minutes instead of days. A maintenance technician can predict equipment failures using smartphone photos and free AI tools. A production supervisor can document complex procedures by simply talking to their computer.

Deming's words ring truer today than ever.    Survival is NOT manditory

The companies choosing not to embrace these accessible AI tools will continue watching their competitive advantage erode. While survival is optional— so is thriving.

Learning to maximize your teams potential with AI!

And unlike previous improvement methodologies that required months of training or massive capital investment, these AI tools can deliver results quickly when your team knows how to apply them effectively.

The key is having experienced guidance to cut through the hype and focus on what actually works.

That's what we do at Fae Intelligence: practical AI training that turns today's overwhelming challenges into tomorrow's competitive advantages.

**The question isn't whether AI will transform manufacturing. It already is.**

**The question is: will your team be ready?**
