Hi [Name],

I was researching local [business type] businesses for a client project and came across [Business Name].

I noticed your Facebook page hasn't been updated since [specific date], and your last Instagram post was [timeframe]. 

This caught my attention because businesses like yours typically see 40-60% more customer engagement when they post consistently on social media.

I specialize in social media management for local [business type] businesses and have a proven system that:
- Creates 30 days of content in advance
- Posts automatically at optimal times
- Engages with customers on your behalf
- Tracks what content brings in customers

Would you be interested in a FREE 30-day trial where I manage your social media completely? No cost, no contracts - just results.

If you like what you see after 30 days, we can discuss a simple monthly plan.

Interested? Just reply "YES" and I'll get started this week.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
