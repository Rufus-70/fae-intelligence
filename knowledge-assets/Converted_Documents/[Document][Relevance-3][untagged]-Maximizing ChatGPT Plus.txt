The objective is to empower users to tailor their ChatGPT experience for diverse applications, moving beyond basic interactions to sophisticated utilization.
Section 1: Accessing and Utilizing Premium Models
ChatGPT Plus subscribers benefit from access to OpenAI's most advanced language models, along with tangible performance advantages. Understanding the distinctions between these models and the benefits of a Plus subscription is crucial for optimizing their use.
1.1. Overview of Models Available to Plus Users
ChatGPT Plus users typically have access to a selection of models, with GPT-4o being the current flagship, alongside GPT-4. While free users may also access GPT-4o, Plus users receive priority and higher usage limits.1
GPT-4o ("omni"):
Description: GPT-4o is OpenAI's latest and most advanced model, designed for native multimodality, meaning it can seamlessly understand and generate combinations of text, audio, image, and video inputs/outputs.1 It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on English text and code but offers significant improvements for non-English languages, vision, and audio understanding, often with faster response times and lower API costs.8 It features a 128k token context length.2
Strengths: Real-time reasoning across audio, vision, and text; superior performance in multilingual tasks, vision understanding, and audio processing (e.g., lower latency in voice interactions, understanding tone).3 It also powers the new advanced image generation capabilities within ChatGPT.10
When to Choose: Ideal for complex tasks requiring multimodal understanding, real-time conversational AI (especially voice), tasks involving visual analysis, or when the highest level of reasoning and multilingual capability is needed.3 It is the default for most Plus user interactions.

GPT-4:
Description: Prior to GPT-4o, GPT-4 was OpenAI's leading model. It is also a large multimodal model (accepting text and image inputs, outputting text) with significant improvements over GPT-3.5 in reasoning, coding, and reliability.1 It features a 128k token context length.2 Although GPT-4.0 (an older iteration) is scheduled for removal from ChatGPT on April 30, 2025 (though remaining available via API), the GPT-4 model accessible to Plus users remains highly capable.12
Strengths: Advanced reasoning, complex instruction following, creative generation, and strong performance on professional and academic benchmarks.9 It demonstrated significantly better performance than GPT-3.5 on exams like the simulated bar exam.9
When to Choose: Excellent for demanding text-based tasks, complex problem-solving, creative writing, and in-depth analysis where GPT-4o's specific multimodal strengths are not the primary requirement, or as an alternative if GPT-4o usage limits are reached.3 Custom GPTs also utilize GPT-4 message quotas.15

Other Models (e.g., o-series, mini models):
The ChatGPT interface may also provide access to specialized reasoning models (like the "o" series, e.g., o1, o3-mini) or more lightweight models (e.g., GPT-4o mini).2
Reasoning Models (o1, o3-mini, etc.): These models are trained to "think" longer and perform multi-step reasoning, excelling at complex problem-solving, coding, scientific reasoning, and agentic workflows.3 They might be preferable for tasks requiring deep, explicit reasoning steps, though GPT-4o is generally recommended for most prompts, especially those involving tools and vision.3
GPT-4o mini: A lighter-weight, faster, and more cost-effective model, often used as a fallback for free users or for tasks where speed is prioritized over maximum capability.2 Plus users might encounter it if GPT-4o limits are hit, or it might power certain high-volume, lower-stakes interactions. It does not have access to all the advanced tools GPT-4o has.2
Selection Criteria: The choice depends on the task's complexity, need for deep reasoning versus speed, and specific tool requirements. The model selector in ChatGPT allows Plus users to switch between available models.3

Table 1.1: ChatGPT Plus Model Usage Limits (Illustrative, as of early-mid 2025)




    *Note: Limits are subject to change by OpenAI and may be reduced during peak hours. Always refer to the latest official OpenAI information.*

The enhanced capabilities of models like GPT-4o, particularly their multimodal nature and improved reasoning, mean that they are not just incrementally better but can tackle new kinds of problems and interact in more nuanced ways. For instance, GPT-4o's ability to process audio with very low latency and understand emotional tone fundamentally changes voice interactions from a transcribed text exchange to a more natural dialogue.5 Similarly, its improved vision capabilities allow for more sophisticated analysis of uploaded images or documents containing visuals.3 This suggests that users who adapt their interaction styles to leverage these multimodal strengths will gain significantly more value.
The provision of higher usage limits and priority access ensures that Plus subscribers can reliably use these advanced models for more substantial tasks without the frequent interruptions or downgrades that free users might experience.1 This reliability is critical for professional or time-sensitive applications. The suite of advanced tools, discussed later in this report, further amplifies the models' capabilities, turning ChatGPT Plus into a multifaceted assistant.
Section 2: Advanced Prompting Strategies for Plus Users
The advanced models available to ChatGPT Plus users, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4, are significantly more capable of understanding nuance, following complex instructions, and generating creative, high-quality outputs. However, unlocking this full potential requires more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques than those sufficient for simpler models.
2.1. Principles of Effective Prompting for Advanced Models
Advanced models respond well to clarity, specificity, and context. Their increased capacity for understanding allows for more elaborate instructions.
Be Clear and Specific: Provide detailed instructions about the desired context, outcome, length, format, style, and persona.21 The more precise the request, the less the model has to infer, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.21 For example, instead of "Write about dogs," a better prompt would be "Write a 500-word blog post for an audience of new dog owners, focusing on positive reinforcement training techniques for puppies, in an encouraging and informative tone."
Source Reference: OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide 21, Best Practices.22
Adopt a Persona: Instructing the model to adopt a specific persona (e.g., "Act as an expert astrophysicist," "You are a witty marketing consultant") can significantly shape the tone, vocabulary, and style of the response.9 GPT-4, for instance, can maintain a persona like a "Shakespearean pirate" throughout a conversation if directed by a system message.9
Source Reference: OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide 21, Wikipedia (GPT-4 capabilities) 9, AdamFard Blog.24
Nuanced Tone Control: Beyond basic personas, users can request specific emotional tones or writing styles with greater fidelity from advanced models. Examples include "firm," "persuasive," "humorous," "academic," etc..24 For instance, "Explain quantum entanglement in a confident but accessible tone, suitable for a high school student."
Source Reference: AdamFard Blog.24
Complex Instruction Following: GPT-4 and GPT-4o excel at handling multi-part prompts or instructions with several constraints.9 Users should not hesitate to provide detailed, step-by-step requirements.
Example: "Generate three marketing slogans for a new eco-friendly coffee brand. Each slogan should be under 10 words, highlight sustainability, and evoke a feeling of morning energy. Present them as a numbered list."
Source Reference: Wikipedia (GPT-4 capabilities) 9, DataCamp 13, OpenAI GPT-4 Announcement.14
2.2. Key Prompt Engineering Techniques
Few-Shot Prompting:
Explanation: Providing the model with a few examples (shots) of the desired input-output behavior within the prompt itself, before posing the actual query.22 This "in-context learning" helps the model understand the task, format, and style expected.
Effectiveness with Advanced Models: More capable models like GPT-4o can generalize better from fewer examples and can handle more complex patterns demonstrated in the shots.
How-to:
Identify the task (e.g., sentiment classification, code generation with specific style, summarizing in a particular format).
Provide 1-5 examples of input and the corresponding desired output.
Clearly delineate examples from the final query.
The format of the examples is important; consistency helps.25
Example (Sentiment Classification):
User: Classify the sentiment of the following movie reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

Review: "This movie was an absolute masterpiece! The acting was superb and the plot was gripping."
Sentiment: Positive

Review: "I was really disappointed. The story was predictable and the characters were flat."
Sentiment: Negative

Review: "It was an okay film. Nothing special, but not terrible either."
Sentiment: Neutral

Review: "Incredible visuals and a powerful message. A must-see!"
Sentiment:

Considerations: The order of examples can matter (placing the best example last can be effective), and there's a balance to strike with the number of examples to avoid using too many tokens.26 Instructions can come before or after examples depending on task complexity.26
Source Reference: OpenAI Best Practices 22, Prompting Guide AI 25, PromptHub.26
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning:
Explanation: Encouraging the model to generate a series of intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final answer, often by adding phrases like "Let's think step by step" or by providing few-shot examples that include the reasoning process.21
Effectiveness with Advanced Models: Particularly useful for complex arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning tasks where advanced models can articulate a coherent thought process. Newer reasoning models like OpenAI's o1-preview even employ this intrinsically.28
How-to:
For zero-shot CoT: Append "Let's think step by step." to your question.
For few-shot CoT: Provide examples where the solution includes the intermediate reasoning steps.
Example (Zero-Shot CoT for a word problem):
User: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends and then found 7 more. If she gave 12 clips to her brother, how many clips does she have left? Let's think step by step.
The model would then ideally break down the problem: initial clips, clips after finding more, clips after giving some away.
Benefits: Improves accuracy on complex reasoning tasks, provides transparency into the model's process, and can help identify where the model might be going wrong.27
Source Reference: OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide 21, Foundation Inc 27, Botpress.28
Using Delimiters:
Explanation: Employing distinct characters or strings (e.g., """, ###, <tag></tag>) to clearly separate different parts of the prompt, such as instructions, context, examples, and input data.21
Benefits: Helps the model distinguish between instructions and content to be processed, reducing ambiguity and improving instruction following, especially for complex prompts.
Example:
Summarize the following text in three bullet points.
Text: """
[Insert long text here]
"""

Source Reference: OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide 21, Best Practices.22
Specifying Output Format and Length:
Explanation: Clearly instructing the model on the desired output format (e.g., JSON, Markdown list, table, specific number of paragraphs) and length (e.g., "in under 100 words," "a concise summary").21
Example: "Provide a comparison of GPT-4 and GPT-4o in a markdown table with columns for Feature, GPT-4, and GPT-4o. Limit the description for each feature to one sentence."
Source Reference: OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide 21, Best Practices.22
Providing Reference Texts:
Explanation: When asking the model to perform tasks based on specific information not in its general training data, include that text directly in the prompt [24 (implied)]. This is crucial for tasks like summarizing provided documents or answering questions based on them.
Source Reference: AdamFard blog.24
The advanced models like GPT-4o and GPT-4 are not merely more knowledgeable; their architecture allows them to better comprehend and execute intricate instructions.9 This means that the effort invested in crafting detailed and structured prompts yields disproportionately better results compared to simpler models. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought prompting are effective because they guide the model through a reasoning pathway that mirrors human problem-solving for complex tasks, reducing the likelihood of superficial or incorrect conclusions.21 The model is essentially externalizing its "thought process," which can be particularly beneficial for tasks requiring logical deduction or multi-step calculations.
Furthermore, the evolution of prompting best practices, as seen with guidance for models like GPT-4.1 which emphasize literal instruction following and specific structures for agentic tasks 29, underscores that prompt engineering is not static. As models become more sophisticated, the methods to interact with them optimally also evolve. Users benefit from staying updated with official OpenAI documentation, such as the Prompt Engineering Guide and the OpenAI Cookbook 21, to adapt their strategies to the nuances of the latest model versions. This continuous learning approach ensures that Plus users can consistently leverage the cutting edge of the models' capabilities.
Section 3: Personalizing Your Experience with Custom Instructions
ChatGPT Plus users can significantly enhance and personalize their interactions by utilizing the "Custom Instructions" feature. This allows for persistent guidance to the AI, tailoring its responses to individual needs and preferences across multiple conversations.
3.1. Understanding Custom Instructions
Custom Instructions enable users to provide ChatGPT with specific information about themselves and their preferences for how the AI should respond. These instructions are automatically applied to all new conversations, obviating the need to repeat contextual information or stylistic requests in every prompt.33 The primary benefit is achieving more tailored, consistent, and relevant outputs that align with the user's specific roles, ongoing projects, or general interaction style.33
ChatGPT considers these instructions for every new chat initiated after they are set, influencing its personality, response style, the information it prioritizes, and its overall behavior.33 It's important to note that any updates made to Custom Instructions will only affect future conversations; existing chats will continue to reflect the instructions that were active at the time of their creation.33 This feature is available on all ChatGPT plans, including Plus, and is accessible across Web, Desktop, iOS, and Android platforms.33
Each of the two input fields for Custom Instructions typically has a character limit of around 1500 characters, which encourages users to be concise yet comprehensive in their directives.34 Regarding data usage, OpenAI states that information from Custom Instructions will be used to improve model performance, for example, by teaching the model how to adapt its responses to user instructions more effectively without overdoing it. Users retain control and can opt out of having their content used for model training.33 If users employ third-party plugins, relevant information from their Custom Instructions may be shared with the plugin developers, underscoring the need to use trusted plugins.33
3.2. Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Custom Instructions
Accessing and configuring Custom Instructions is straightforward:
Accessing the Feature:
On iOS & Android: Open the ChatGPT app, navigate to Settings, select Customize ChatGPT, and then toggle the "Enable for new chats" option to ON.33
On Web & Desktop: Go to the ChatGPT website, access Settings, select Personalization, click on Custom Instructions, and toggle "Enable for new chats" to ON.33
The Two Input Fields: 33
The feature is structured around two distinct input fields, each serving a specific purpose in guiding the AI's behavior:
Field 1: "What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?"
Purpose: This field is for providing ChatGPT with context about the user. This can include their background, profession, level of expertise in certain subjects, specific goals, interests, location, or any other information that helps the AI understand their perspective and requirements more deeply.
Influence: The information entered here primarily influences the content, relevance, and depth of ChatGPT's responses. For instance, if a user states they are a beginner in a particular subject, ChatGPT will likely provide simpler explanations and avoid overly technical jargon. Conversely, if a user indicates expertise, the AI might offer more advanced and detailed information.
Field 2: "How would you like ChatGPT to respond?"
Purpose: This field allows the user to define their preferences for the AI's output characteristics. This includes the desired tone (e.g., formal, informal, humorous), style (e.g., academic, conversational), personality (e.g., witty, empathetic, direct), response length (e.g., concise, detailed), formatting preferences (e.g., use bullet points, provide tables), and any specific constraints on its behavior (e.g., "always cite sources," "avoid disclaimers about being an AI," "respond as a specific character").
Influence: This field primarily shapes the delivery, manner, and structure of ChatGPT's responses. It allows users to receive information in a way that best suits their comprehension and preferences.
Enabling/Disabling: Custom Instructions can be toggled on or off for new chats at any time. Users can also edit or delete their instructions, with changes applying to subsequent new conversations.33
3.3. Effective Use Cases and Examples
Custom Instructions can be powerfully employed in various scenarios:
Tailoring for Specific Professional Roles:
Software Developer:
Field 1: "I am a senior Python developer specializing in machine learning applications. I prioritize code readability and adherence to PEP 8 standards." 35
Field 2: "Provide code solutions in Python. Offer explanations for complex algorithms. When discussing libraries, mention performance considerations. Format code blocks with syntax highlighting. Be concise." 35
Content Creator/Marketer:
Field 1: "I am a digital marketing manager for a B2B SaaS company targeting small to medium-sized businesses. My primary goal is lead generation." 35
Field 2: "Respond in a professional yet persuasive tone. Suggest actionable marketing strategies. When brainstorming content, focus on topics relevant to SMB pain points. Provide examples of successful campaigns. Always include a call to action. Structure responses for easy readability, using headings and bullet points." 35

The Custom Instructions feature effectively allows users to establish a persistent "system message" or a set of meta-instructions that guide the AI's behavior across different chat sessions.9 This capability, often associated with more technical API usage, becomes accessible to all Plus users through a simple interface, democratizing a significant level of personalization and control.
However, it is worth noting that the consistency of adherence to these instructions might vary. Observations suggest that some models, or interactions involving multiple active tools or very long conversation histories, might not follow Custom Instructions with perfect fidelity.37 For instance, user tests have indicated potential inconsistencies with GPT-4o compared to other models, or that enabling many tools can add "overhead" to the system prompt, potentially diluting the impact of custom directives.37 This suggests that while Custom Instructions are a powerful tool, users may occasionally need to experiment with phrasing, simplify their instructions, or even gently remind the AI of their preferences within a chat, especially in complex scenarios or with the newest model iterations.
Furthermore, OpenAI's explicit statement that "Information from your use of custom instructions will also be used to improve model performance" 33 indicates that users are, in effect, contributing to the ongoing refinement of how these models interpret and respond to personalized directives. This feedback loop can lead to improved adherence and more nuanced responses in future model updates, highlighting a co-evolutionary aspect of user interaction and model development. Users concerned about data privacy should familiarize themselves with OpenAI's data control options.33
Section 4: Creating and Utilizing Custom GPTs
One of the most powerful features available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Enterprise users is the ability to create Custom GPTs. These are personalized versions of ChatGPT, tailored by the user for specific tasks, topics, or functionalities by combining unique instructions, supplementary knowledge, and selected capabilities.
4.1. Introduction to Custom GPTs
Custom GPTs represent a significant step towards democratizing AI application development, allowing users to build specialized AI assistants without needing coding expertise.39 They can range from simple tools designed for a niche task to complex assistants integrated with external data and services.39
For Plus users, Custom GPTs offer several distinct benefits:
Specialization: By providing specific instructions and "Knowledge" (uploaded files), a Custom GPT can be focused on a particular domain, leading to more accurate, relevant, and in-depth responses compared to the general ChatGPT model.42 For example, a Custom GPT trained on a company's internal documentation can serve as an expert support tool for employees.
Efficiency: Custom GPTs can automate repetitive tasks or streamline complex workflows by having a pre-configured AI assistant ready to perform specific functions, saving time and effort.42
Enhanced Personalization: They embed the creator's specific instructions, preferred style, and necessary knowledge directly into the GPT, eliminating the need to re-prompt with the same context in every new chat.43
Sharing and Collaboration: Useful Custom GPTs can be shared with individuals, teams, or even published to the public GPT Store, allowing others to benefit from these tailored AI tools.39

4.2. Building a Custom GPT: A Detailed Walkthrough
The process of creating a Custom GPT is facilitated by the GPT Builder, an interactive interface within ChatGPT.
Accessing the GPT Builder:
Users can start building a Custom GPT by navigating to chatgpt.com/create or chatgpt.com/gpts/editor. Alternatively, from the chatgpt.com/gpts page (Explore GPTs), users can click the "+ Create" button.39 The builder interface presents two main tabs: "Create" for a conversational setup process, and "Configure" for more detailed, manual settings.39
Defining Purpose and Core Instructions (using the 'Create' tab):
The "Create" tab allows users to define their Custom GPT by simply chatting with the GPT Builder. Users describe the desired behavior, role, and overall goal of their Custom GPT. For instance, a user might prompt the Builder with: "Make an AI assistant that helps brainstorm and outline blog posts for a tech audience" or "Create a GPT that acts as a friendly language tutor for Spanish, focusing on conversational practice".39 Based on this conversation, the GPT Builder will suggest a name, a description, and even generate a profile picture for the Custom GPT, all of which can be further refined by the user.43
Refining in the 'Configure' Tab: 39
The "Configure" tab offers a more structured way to fine-tune the Custom GPT:
Name & Description: Users can set or modify the name and descriptive summary of their GPT. These should clearly communicate its purpose.
Instructions: This is arguably the most critical field. Here, users provide detailed, explicit guidelines on how the GPT should behave, its functionalities, its personality or tone, specific knowledge areas to draw upon or avoid, and any behaviors it should exhibit or refrain from. Effective prompt engineering principles are vital here to ensure the GPT performs as intended.43
Profile Picture/Icon: Users can request the GPT Builder to generate a unique image for their Custom GPT or upload their own custom image. This image serves as the visual identifier for the GPT.39
Crafting Effective Conversation Starters:
Conversation starters are pre-defined example prompts that are displayed to users when they first interact with the Custom GPT.39 Their purpose is to guide users on how to begin a conversation and to showcase the GPT's primary functions or common use cases. For a Custom GPT designed as a "Historical Fact Checker," conversation starters might include: "Verify a historical claim about World War II," "What were the main causes of the French Revolution?" or "Tell me about daily life in ancient Rome."
Source Reference: OpenAI Help Center 39, BYU GenAI.43
4.3. Personalizing with "Knowledge"
The "Knowledge" feature allows builders to significantly personalize their Custom GPTs by uploading files that provide additional context or specific information for the GPT to reference during its interactions.39 This capability effectively implements a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where the model retrieves information from the provided documents to inform its responses, rather than relying solely on its general training data.43
File Limits and Types:
A builder can upload up to 20 files to a single Custom GPT.39 Each individual file can be up to 512 MB in size and can contain up to 2,000,000 tokens (a measure of text length).45 While files containing images can be uploaded, the system currently processes only the textual content within these files; the visual information from images in knowledge files is not directly interpreted by the GPT in this context.45 (This may evolve with the enhanced multimodal capabilities of models like GPT-4o).
How Custom GPTs Use Knowledge: 45
When files are uploaded to a Custom GPT's knowledge base, the system processes them by:
Breaking the text content into smaller, manageable chunks.
Creating "embeddings" for these chunks – these are numerical (vector) representations of the text that capture semantic meaning.
Storing these embeddings for efficient retrieval later.
When a user interacts with the Custom GPT, the model can access these uploaded files to obtain additional context relevant to the user's prompt. It typically chooses one of two methods based on the nature of the query:
Semantic Search: For prompts that are question-like or require specific pieces of information (e.g., "What is our company's policy on remote work?"), the GPT performs a semantic search over the embedded knowledge to find and return the most relevant text chunks.
Document Review: For tasks like summarization, translation, or when a broader understanding of a document is needed, the GPT may retrieve and use entire short documents or relevant, extended excerpts from larger documents as part of its context.
Best Practices for Knowledge Files: 45
To maximize the effectiveness of the Knowledge feature:
Formatting: Use simple, clean formatting for uploaded documents. Single-column text layouts are ideal. The parser may struggle with complex layouts like multi-column PDFs or understanding the nuanced positioning of text on presentation slides.
Prioritization: In the "Instructions" field of the Custom GPT configuration, builders can guide the GPT to prioritize information from its uploaded Knowledge files before resorting to a general web search (if that capability is enabled).
Citations: By default, Custom GPTs will avoid revealing the names of the files they draw information from. If the builder wants the GPT to "cite its sources" by referring to specific uploaded documents, this must be explicitly stated in the "Instructions."
Source Reference: OpenAI Help Center 39, BYU GenAI.43
4.4. Integrating and Configuring Capabilities
Located in the 'Configure' tab of the GPT Builder, "Capabilities" are toggles that enable various built-in functionalities, allowing the Custom GPT to perform a wider range of actions.39
Web Browsing (Web Search): Enabling this capability allows the Custom GPT to access and process real-time information from the internet, similar to the standard ChatGPT search feature. This is useful for tasks requiring up-to-date information or broader context beyond its training data and uploaded Knowledge.39
DALL-E Image Generation (now often GPT-4o Image Generation): This enables the Custom GPT to create original images based on textual descriptions provided by the user or generated by the GPT itself as part of a task. Custom GPTs with "4o Image Generation" enabled will utilize the newer, more advanced image generation model.11
Code Interpreter / Advanced Data Analysis: Activating this powerful capability allows the Custom GPT to write and execute Python code within a secure, sandboxed environment. This enables a wide array of functionalities, including data analysis from uploaded files, file manipulation (e.g., converting formats, editing content), creating charts and graphs for data visualization, and solving complex mathematical problems.39 It is crucial to ensure this capability is enabled if the Custom GPT is intended to perform such tasks; otherwise, it may fail or underperform.39
Canvas: This is another listed capability that provides additional functionality.39 The specific nature of "Canvas" and its applications would require more detailed documentation, but it generally implies tools for more visual or structured interactions or outputs.
Custom Actions (API Integration): This is an advanced feature that allows builders to connect their Custom GPT to external third-party APIs. This is achieved by defining the API endpoints, the necessary parameters, authentication methods, and providing a description of how the model should utilize these APIs, often through an OpenAPI schema.39
Custom Actions empower GPTs to retrieve data from external sources (e.g., query a customer database, fetch product information from an e-commerce API) or perform actions in other systems (e.g., create a ticket in a project management tool, send an email via an email API).47
Configuration typically involves setting up authentication (e.g., API Key, OAuth 2.0) to securely connect to the external service.48
For Custom GPTs intended for public use in the GPT Store that utilize Custom Actions calling an external API, domain verification for the API and a publicly accessible Privacy Policy URL are mandatory.44

4.5. Sharing and the GPT Store
Once a Custom GPT is built and configured, creators have options for how it can be shared and accessed.
Publishing Options: 39
When publishing a Custom GPT, creators can choose from three main visibility settings:
Private: The GPT is only visible to and usable by its creator.
Anyone with link: The GPT is unlisted (not discoverable through search in the GPT Store) but can be shared with others via a direct URL.
Everyone: The GPT is listed publicly in the GPT Store, making it discoverable by all ChatGPT users. Publishing to "Everyone" requires the creator to have a verified Builder Profile.
Builder Profile: To publish a GPT to the public GPT Store, creators must first verify their Builder Profile. This can be done either through Name Verification (matching the name on their ChatGPT Plus billing profile) or optionally through Domain Verification (linking a verified website domain to their profile).44 Builders can also link social media profiles (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn) to their Builder Profile to add credibility.44
GPT Store: The GPT Store is a marketplace within ChatGPT where users can discover, browse, and use a vast array of Custom GPTs created by both the community and OpenAI itself.40 GPTs in the Store are searchable and often categorized (e.g., Productivity, Education, Lifestyle) to aid discovery. OpenAI may also spotlight particularly useful or innovative GPTs.40
Review Process: All GPTs submitted for public listing in the GPT Store undergo a review process. This typically involves automated checks against OpenAI's usage policies and may include manual review if any potential issues are flagged.44 This process aims to ensure safety and compliance.

Table 4.1: Custom GPT Configuration Options

The introduction of Custom GPTs marks a significant evolution in how users can interact with and leverage large language models. It shifts the paradigm from using a single, general-purpose AI to creating and deploying a multitude of specialized AI assistants, each fine-tuned for particular tasks or knowledge domains.39 This democratization of AI tool creation, enabling even non-coders to build their own GPTs through a conversational interface, is a key development.40 The effectiveness of these Custom GPTs, especially their specialization, heavily relies on the "Knowledge" feature. The ability to upload specific documents effectively grounds the GPT in relevant, often proprietary, information, enabling a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation that enhances accuracy and contextual relevance.43
Furthermore, the combination of detailed instructions, uploaded knowledge, and functional capabilities—particularly Custom Actions for API integration and Code Interpreter for data execution—positions Custom GPTs as an early, accessible form of AI agents.40 These are systems that can not only process information but also perform tasks and interact with external services with a degree of autonomy based on user-defined goals. OpenAI's own announcements have framed Custom GPTs as a step towards such agentic AI 40, and the underlying models, like GPT-4o 51, are increasingly designed to support these more complex, multi-step operations.52 For Plus users, this means they are at the forefront of experiencing, building, and shaping these emerging agent-like AI systems.
Section 5: Leveraging Integrated Tools within ChatGPT Plus
ChatGPT Plus provides users with a suite of powerful integrated tools that extend the capabilities of the core language models. These tools enable access to real-time information, image creation, and sophisticated data analysis directly within the chat interface, transforming ChatGPT into a versatile workbench.
5.1. Web Browse (ChatGPT Search)
The Web Browse feature, often referred to as ChatGPT Search, allows ChatGPT to access, process, and synthesize information from the internet in real-time.53 This capability is crucial for queries that require up-to-date information, current events, or context beyond the model's training data cutoff.
Functionality: When activated, ChatGPT can perform web searches, retrieve content from web pages, and summarize this information to answer user queries. It aims to provide timely answers and includes links to the sources it used, allowing users to verify the information.53
How to Use:
Users can explicitly invoke the search tool by selecting "View all tools" next to the message input bar and then choosing the "Search" icon, or by typing / in the input bar and selecting "Search" from the pop-up menu.53
Alternatively, ChatGPT may automatically decide to use web search if it determines that the user's query would benefit from current information available online.53
Responses generated using web search will typically include inline citations. On desktop, users can hover over these citations to see more details and click to navigate to the source page. A "Sources" button at the end of the response provides a consolidated list of all referenced links.53
Users also have the option to regenerate a GPT-4o response to explicitly include a web search if the initial response did not use one.53
Operational Details:
When performing a search, ChatGPT might rephrase the user's original query into one or more targeted search queries that it sends to its search partners.53
To enhance the relevance of local searches (e.g., "best coffee shops near me"), ChatGPT may use general location information derived from the user's IP address. However, the IP address itself or specific account information is not shared with third-party search providers.53
If the "Memory" feature is enabled in ChatGPT settings, the system may leverage relevant information from past conversations to refine search queries and make them more contextually appropriate.53
Practical Examples:
"What were the main outcomes of the G7 summit that concluded yesterday?" (Current Events)
"Provide a summary of recent reviews for the latest Tesla Model Y." (Product Research) 53
"Find academic papers published in the last six months discussing the impact of microplastics on marine ecosystems." (Scientific Research)
"What is the weather forecast for London for the upcoming weekend?" (Real-time Information) 53
Availability: ChatGPT Search is available to all ChatGPT users, including those on the Plus plan. Plus users benefit from the search and synthesis being performed by the more advanced underlying models like GPT-4o.53

5.2. DALL-E Image Generation (Native GPT-4o Image Generation)
ChatGPT Plus integrates advanced image generation capabilities, now primarily powered by GPT-4o's native multimodal architecture.10 This allows users to create and refine original images directly within their conversations. While the DALL-E GPT remains accessible for those who prefer it, GPT-4o's image generation is the default and offers several enhancements.11
Key Improvements with GPT-4o Image Generation: 10
Enhanced Text Rendering: GPT-4o demonstrates improved ability to accurately render text within generated images, a common challenge for previous models.
Multi-turn Conversational Refinement: Users can iteratively refine images through natural conversation. GPT-4o can build upon previous images and text within the chat context, ensuring stylistic and content consistency across iterations.
Superior Instruction Following: The model can handle more complex prompts involving a greater number of objects (reportedly 10-20) and exhibits better binding of attributes to those objects.
In-context Learning from Uploaded Images: GPT-4o can analyze user-uploaded images and integrate their details or styles into its context to inform new image generations.
Integrated World Knowledge: The native integration allows GPT-4o to better link its vast textual knowledge base with its image generation capabilities, resulting in more contextually aware and intelligent outputs.
How to Use:
Users can simply ask ChatGPT to create an image by providing a detailed textual description (e.g., "Generate a whimsical illustration of a cat reading a book in a cozy library, in a storybook art style").11
Alternatively, the "Create image" option can be selected from the "View all tools" menu.11
To edit an existing image (either uploaded or previously generated), users can click on the image and use the "Select tool" (typically found in the top-right corner of the image view). This tool allows selecting an area of the image to be modified, with changes described via text prompt.11
Techniques for Crafting Effective Image Prompts:
Be Specific and Detailed: The more detail provided regarding subjects, objects, colors, artistic styles, lighting, composition, mood, and even camera angles or lens types (e.g., "wide angle," "macro shot," "18mm objective"), the more likely the output will match the user's vision.22
Example: "A hyperrealistic digital painting of an ancient, moss-covered stone golem awakening in a misty forest. Glowing runes cover its body. Cinematic lighting, dramatic low-angle shot."
Specify Artistic Styles and Mediums: Use terms like "impressionist painting," "surrealism," "cyberpunk art," "photorealistic," "watercolor sketch," "3D render," "pixel art," or "in the style of [famous artist]".55 For photorealism, using "photo style" can sometimes yield better results than "photorealistic" which might trigger painterly styles.54
Use Descriptive Adjectives and Layered Descriptions: Build up the scene with rich adjectives and provide details in layers to combine multiple elements effectively.55
Avoid Negative Prompting: DALL-E models generally struggle with negative instructions (e.g., "no red cars"). Instead, focus on describing what should be present in the image.54 For example, instead of "a forest with no people," try "a serene, empty forest path."
Iterate and Refine: Image generation is often an iterative process. Start with a broader concept and then refine the prompt based on the initial results. Leverage ChatGPT's conversational ability to request modifications (e.g., "Make the dragon larger," "Change the background to a stormy sky").10
Prompt Structure: A common recommendation is to start the prompt with the most important subject or element, followed by details, mood descriptors, and finally any technical instructions (like style or camera view).54
Controlling GPT's Prompt Modification: ChatGPT may rephrase or expand user prompts before sending them to the image generation model. If precise control over the prompt sent to DALL-E is desired, users can instruct ChatGPT with phrases like "Use the following prompt for image generation exactly as written: [your prompt]".54
Limitations and Considerations: While significantly improved, image generation models may still face challenges with highly complex text rendering, consistently reusing specific characters or scenes across multiple distinct images without very careful and iterative prompting, and understanding nuanced cause-and-effect relationships unless explicitly described.54 All image generation is subject to OpenAI's content policies, which prohibit the creation of explicit, hateful, violent, or deceptive content, and restrict the generation of images resembling living public figures or directly copying the distinct styles of living artists without permission.55

The Code Interpreter, now more commonly referred to as Advanced Data Analysis (ADA), is a powerful integrated tool that provides ChatGPT Plus users with the ability to upload files, execute Python code in a secure sandboxed environment, perform complex data analysis, and generate visualizations.39
Functionality and How it Works: 58
File Upload: The user uploads one or more data files (or provides data directly in the prompt).
Instruction: The user provides natural language instructions on what analysis or operations to perform.
Code Generation: ChatGPT (ADA) writes Python code to accomplish the requested task. It has access to a wide range of pre-loaded Python libraries commonly used for data science, such as pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib or Plotly for creating charts.
Code Execution: The generated Python code is executed in a persistent, secure, sandboxed environment.
Result Interpretation & Presentation: ChatGPT examines the output of the code execution (including any data, tables, charts, or errors). It then integrates these results into a natural language response for the user, often including the generated tables or charts directly in the chat. Users can also typically request to download processed files (e.g., a cleaned dataset, a generated report).
Transparency: Users can view the actual Python code generated and executed by ChatGPT by clicking on a "[>_]" (View Analysis) link that often appears with the response. This allows for verification and understanding of the process.
Capabilities:
Data Analysis: Capable of a wide range of analytical tasks, including data cleaning (handling missing values, correcting errors), statistical analysis (descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression), trend identification, pattern recognition, and summarizing large datasets.58
Code Execution: Beyond data analysis, it can run Python scripts for various purposes, such as text processing, mathematical computations, simple simulations, file format conversions, and more.
File Handling:
Uploads: Supports a variety of common file formats, including Excel spreadsheets (.xls, .xlsx), Comma-Separated Values files (.csv), Portable Document Format files (.pdf), and JSON files (.json). It also allows direct uploads from cloud storage services like Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive (including SharePoint).58 Users can upload up to 10 files within a single conversation, with an individual file size limit of 512 MB (though for CSVs and spreadsheets, a practical limit around 50MB may apply depending on row complexity).58 Uploaded files are typically deleted after a certain period based on the user's plan.58
Downloads: ADA can generate new files based on its processing (e.g., a cleaned CSV, a PDF report containing analysis, an image file like a QR code) and provide users with a download link for these files.
Generating Visualizations: Can create a variety of static and interactive charts to help users visualize data. Common interactive charts include bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and line charts. A broader range of static charts like histograms, box plots, heat maps, area charts, and treemaps can also be generated.58 Users can often request customizations to these charts.
Practical Examples:
"Upload this customer_feedback.csv file. Perform sentiment analysis on the 'comments' column and show me a bar chart of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment counts." 58
"I've uploaded financial_data.xlsx. Can you calculate the quarterly revenue growth rate for the past two years and visualize it as a line graph? Also, identify any significant outliers."
"Convert the attached PDF document, research_paper.pdf, into a plain text file. Then, extract all email addresses mentioned in the text."
"Generate a Python script to simulate 1000 coin flips and plot a histogram of the number of heads obtained in sets of 10 flips."
"Analyze the provided website_traffic.json data to identify the top 5 referral sources and create a pie chart showing their contribution to total traffic."
Best Practices for File Uploads: For tabular data, it's recommended to use descriptive column headers in the first row, use plain language for these headers (avoiding obscure acronyms or jargon), and ensure each row represents a single record or observation.58
