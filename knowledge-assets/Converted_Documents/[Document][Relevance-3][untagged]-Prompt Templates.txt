 The CAPA Assistant guides the user through initiating a CAPA via a two-phase process with a defined transition point:

Phase 1: Information Gathering & Preliminary Assessment (The First Pass - Free): The system helps the user structure the initial problem details. The AI analyzes this basic input to provide a preliminary assessment, propose top potential areas for investigation, and identify what additional information is needed, prioritizing the most impactful data points for investigation. The output of this phase is a structured guide for the user's real-world data collection efforts. This phase is provided at no cost to the user.
Transition to Phase 2 (Data Submission & Pricing): The user gathers the requested information outside the system. When ready for deeper AI analysis, they use a "Proceed" function within the application. They will indicate what data they have collected and wish to submit. The system will then present pricing for Phase 2 analysis based on the volume and type of data being submitted.
Phase 2: Report Generation & Refinement (Paid based on Data Submitted): Upon user confirmation and payment (or agreement to terms), the AI processes all the submitted data using dedicated prompts to generate comprehensive preliminary CAPA report sections. The user can then review, modify, and finalize this draft report within the application.
Phase 1: Information Gathering & Preliminary Assessment (The First Pass)

 This phase is the user's initial interaction after providing a basic problem description. Its output structures the problem, offers initial hypotheses, and crucially guides the user on what data to collect next and where to focus their efforts.

System Action: The CAPA Assistant presents the user with an interface requesting specific initial details about the non-conformity (Problem Statement, any known context).

User Action: The user inputs the initially available information into the system.

AI Processing: Upon receiving the initial input, the AI uses the following detailed prompt text to generate a structured preliminary assessment.

AI Prompt Text (Used by the system for Phase 1 Output):

Response 1 - 1. Understanding the Submitted Problem

 Summary:

 Stainless Steel 316L femoral component prototypes from Lot # SS316L-Proto-007 exhibit dimensional non-conformance (undersized distal bore diameter) and surface finish issues (excessive Ra on condyle surfaces) identified during in-process CMM inspection. Rework is not an option.

 Categorization (Preliminary):

 Preliminary categorization indicates this is a process control issue within the CNC milling operation, potentially influenced by tooling and/or material variations.

 Scope (Preliminary):

 The non-conformance affects at least one lot of Stainless Steel 316L femoral component prototypes (Lot # SS316L-Proto-007) and specifically impacts the distal bore diameter and condyle surface finish. The scope is currently limited to the CNC milling operation.

 Key Factors Stated in Problem Statement:

Dimensional non-conformance detected: Distal bore undersized by 0.05mm (-0.05 / +0.00mm tolerance, nominal Ø12.00mm).
Surface finish non-conformance: Condyle surfaces exceed specified Ra 0.8 µm (measured 1.1-1.4 µm).
Material: Stainless Steel 316L.
Manufacturing Process: CNC milling.
Product Stage: Prototypes.
Identification Method: In-process CMM inspection for Lot # SS316L-Proto-007.
Rework is not an option for this feature.
Response 2

 Assumptions Made:

The CMM inspection procedure is validated and correctly implemented.
The referenced tolerance is bilateral (-0.05mm / +0.00mm).
The Ra measurement equipment is calibrated and suitable for the specified surface finish.
2. Preliminary Hypotheses: Top 3 Potential Areas

 These are preliminary hypotheses based solely on the initial problem description and require further investigation and data analysis to validate or refute.

 Hypothesis Area 1:

 CNC Milling Program Error: The G-code program used for the CNC milling operation may contain errors or offsets that are causing the undersized bore diameter and unacceptable surface finish.

 Hypothesis Area 2:

 Tooling Issues: The cutting tools used in the CNC milling process may be worn, damaged, or not suitable for achieving the required dimensional accuracy and surface finish on Stainless Steel 316L.

 Hypothesis Area 3:

 Process Parameter Deviation: The CNC milling process parameters (speeds, feeds, depth of cut, coolant) may have deviated from the validated or established settings, leading to the non-conformance.

 3. Information Needed for Comprehensive Assessment (Prioritized)

 To conduct a thorough CAPA investigation, we need to gather more information to confirm the nature and scope of the problem and to identify potential root causes. The following list outlines the key data points needed, categorized by priority.

 High Priority Information

CNC Milling Program (G-code) used for Lot # SS316L-Proto-007, including revision history.

 Critical to determine if the program itself is generating the incorrect dimensions and surface finish. Revision history is vital to understand if recent changes correlate with the onset of the problem.

CMM Inspection Reports (full data, not just pass/fail) for multiple parts from Lot # SS316L-Proto-007, including calibration records for the CMM equipment used.

 Essential for verifying the dimensional non-conformance and surface finish issues, assessing the consistency of the problem across the lot, and ensuring the CMM is accurate and calibrated.

Material Certificates of Conformance (CoC) for the Stainless Steel 316L used in Lot # SS316L-Proto-007.

 Needed to confirm the material meets the specified requirements and rule out material-related issues (e.g., incorrect alloy composition, hardness variations) that could affect machinability and surface finish.

Tooling specifications and condition for the CNC milling operation, including tool type, geometry, coating (if any), usage hours, and inspection records.

 Worn or incorrect tooling can directly contribute to dimensional inaccuracies and poor surface finish. Inspection records can indicate tool wear patterns or damage.

Process parameters (speeds, feeds, depth of cut, coolant type/concentration) used during CNC milling for Lot # SS316L-Proto-007, ideally captured in a process sheet or traveler.

 Incorrect process parameters can lead to excessive tool wear, vibration, and ultimately, dimensional and surface finish problems. Need to compare against validated parameters.

Medium Priority Information

CNC machine maintenance records (recent preventative maintenance, repairs).

 Machine malfunctions or lack of maintenance could lead to vibrations or inaccuracies that impact dimensional control and surface finish.

Process Validation records for the CNC milling operation for this type of femoral component.

 If process validation exists, review to determine if the current process deviates from the validated parameters and if the validation included surface finish testing.

Control plan for the CNC milling process, including in-process inspection points and acceptance criteria.

 The control plan can indicate whether the in-process inspections were adequate to detect the non-conformance early and whether the acceptance criteria were appropriate.

Low Priority Information (Supporting Details)

Operator training records for the CNC milling machine and CMM inspection.

 While less likely, inadequate operator training could contribute to setup errors or incorrect inspection procedures. Verify personnel are qualified.

Environmental conditions in the CNC milling area (temperature, humidity).

 Extreme variations in temperature or humidity could (less likely) affect the dimensional stability of the material or the CNC machine.

The investigation should begin by gathering the high-priority data points to quickly assess the most likely root causes related to the CNC program, CMM accuracy, material, tooling, and process parameters. Further data collection may be required based on the initial findings.

4. Information Needed for Comprehensive Assessment (Prioritized & Linked to Fishbone)

 To move forward with a thorough investigation and validate hypotheses (Section 2) by exploring the categories above (Section 3), we need more specific information. Please gather details on the following, focusing on the High Priority items first. Each item is linked to the relevant Fishbone category number(s):

High Priority Information: * [Specific data point 1] (Relevant to Fishbone #) - [Briefly explain why it's high priority] * [Specific data point 2] (Relevant to Fishbone #, #) - [Briefly explain why it's high priority] * (...list 3-5 most critical items, linking each)
Medium Priority Information: * [Specific data point 1] (Relevant to Fishbone #) * [Specific data point 2] (Relevant to Fishbone #, #) * (...list relevant items, linking each)
Low Priority Information (Supporting Details): * [Specific data point 1] (Relevant to Fishbone #) * [Specific data point 2] (Relevant to Fishbone #) * (...list relevant items, linking each) Gathering this information will allow us to perform a more detailed root cause analysis and build a robust CAPA plan. Focus your initial efforts on the High Priority items, using the Fishbone categories as a guide for potential areas to explore. Let me know when you have gathered information and are ready to proceed to the next phase for deeper analysis.`
Transition to Phase 2 (Data Submission & Pricing)

 After reviewing the Phase 1 output, the user will work outside the system to gather the requested information, starting with the high-priority items guided by the Fishbone categories. When they have collected data they want the AI to analyze for preliminary report generation (Phase 2), they will use a dedicated function or button in the application.

User Action: The user indicates they are ready to proceed and specifies (or uploads) the types/volume of data they have collected based on the Phase 1 guidance.
System Action (Pricing): Based on the volume and complexity of the data the user indicates they will submit (e.g., number of documents, size of data files, type of data like inspection reports, process logs, material certifications), the system calculates and presents the pricing for the Phase 2 analysis. The user must confirm they accept the cost to proceed.
Mechanism: This is represented by a "Proceed to Phase 2 Analysis" button or link, which leads to a data submission and pricing confirmation screen.
Phase 2: Report Generation & Refinement (Paid)

 Once the user has agreed to the pricing and submitted their gathered information, the AI performs a deeper analysis using the submitted data to generate content for the standard sections of a CAPA report.

User Action: Submits the gathered information (e.g., uploading files, inputting summarized data).
System Action: The AI processes all the submitted information using dedicated prompt templates for each report section. This analysis is significantly more informed than the Phase 1 assessment due to the additional data.
Core Features (AI Generation based on submitted data):
CAPA Background Generation: Generates a concise background based on all available problem description, context, and newly submitted relevant data.
Potential Cause Identification: Identifies likely root causes based on all available data and preliminary investigation findings (if provided), potentially refining the Fishbone categories or drilling down into specific causes within those categories.
Initial Containment Action Suggestion: Suggests containment actions based on the problem and collected data.
Recommended Investigation Steps Suggestion: Suggests logical next steps for formal root cause investigation based on the current understanding from the submitted data.
Potential Corrective Actions Suggestion: Recommends strong, risk-reducing corrective actions based on likely root causes identified from the submitted data.
Potential Preventive Actions Suggestion: Suggests ways to prevent similar issues across the process or organization based on potential systemic issues indicated by the submitted data.

Structured Report Display: The generated report sections are displayed in a structured and user-friendly format within the application, allowing the user to easily review, modify, add to, and finalize the preliminary CAPA draft.
Style Guidelines:

Primary color: Use a calming blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust and reliability.
Secondary color: Use a light gray (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds to ensure readability and reduce visual clutter.
Accent: Use a vibrant green (#90EE90) to highlight key actions and suggestions.
Use clear and professional typography to ensure readability and convey authority.
Employ a structured layout with clear section headings and bullet points to organize information effectively.
Use simple, intuitive icons to visually represent different sections and actions within the CAPA report.
AI Prompt Templates (Used in Phase 2 with submitted data):

 (These are the detailed prompt templates for generating each specific section of the report, executed in Phase 2 using the data submitted by the user. They would need to be updated internally to reference the newly provided data as part of their input context.)

Response 1 - 1. Understanding the Submitted Problem

 Summary:

 Stainless Steel 316L femoral component prototypes from Lot # SS316L-Proto-007 exhibit dimensional non-conformance (undersized distal bore diameter) and surface finish issues (excessive Ra on condyle surfaces) identified during in-process CMM inspection. Rework is not an option.

 Categorization (Preliminary):

 Preliminary categorization indicates this is a process control issue within the CNC milling operation, potentially influenced by tooling and/or material variations.

 Scope (Preliminary):

 The non-conformance affects at least one lot of Stainless Steel 316L femoral component prototypes (Lot # SS316L-Proto-007) and specifically impacts the distal bore diameter and condyle surface finish. The scope is currently limited to the CNC milling operation.

 Key Factors Stated in Problem Statement:

Dimensional non-conformance detected: Distal bore undersized by 0.05mm (-0.05 / +0.00mm tolerance, nominal Ø12.00mm).
Surface finish non-conformance: Condyle surfaces exceed specified Ra 0.8 µm (measured 1.1-1.4 µm).
Material: Stainless Steel 316L.
Manufacturing Process: CNC milling.
Product Stage: Prototypes.
Identification Method: In-process CMM inspection for Lot # SS316L-Proto-007.
Rework is not an option for this feature.
Response 2

 Assumptions Made:

The CMM inspection procedure is validated and correctly implemented.
The referenced tolerance is bilateral (-0.05mm / +0.00mm).
The Ra measurement equipment is calibrated and suitable for the specified surface finish.
2. Preliminary Hypotheses: Top 3 Potential Areas

 These are preliminary hypotheses based solely on the initial problem description and require further investigation and data analysis to validate or refute.

 Hypothesis Area 1:

 CNC Milling Program Error: The G-code program used for the CNC milling operation may contain errors or offsets that are causing the undersized bore diameter and unacceptable surface finish.

 Hypothesis Area 2:

 Tooling Issues: The cutting tools used in the CNC milling process may be worn, damaged, or not suitable for achieving the required dimensional accuracy and surface finish on Stainless Steel 316L.

 Hypothesis Area 3:

 Process Parameter Deviation: The CNC milling process parameters (speeds, feeds, depth of cut, coolant) may have deviated from the validated or established settings, leading to the non-conformance.

 3. Information Needed for Comprehensive Assessment (Prioritized)

 To conduct a thorough CAPA investigation, we need to gather more information to confirm the nature and scope of the problem and to identify potential root causes. The following list outlines the key data points needed, categorized by priority.

 High Priority Information

CNC Milling Program (G-code) used for Lot # SS316L-Proto-007, including revision history.

 Critical to determine if the program itself is generating the incorrect dimensions and surface finish. Revision history is vital to understand if recent changes correlate with the onset of the problem.

CMM Inspection Reports (full data, not just pass/fail) for multiple parts from Lot # SS316L-Proto-007, including calibration records for the CMM equipment used.

 Essential for verifying the dimensional non-conformance and surface finish issues, assessing the consistency of the problem across the lot, and ensuring the CMM is accurate and calibrated.

Material Certificates of Conformance (CoC) for the Stainless Steel 316L used in Lot # SS316L-Proto-007.

 Needed to confirm the material meets the specified requirements and rule out material-related issues (e.g., incorrect alloy composition, hardness variations) that could affect machinability and surface finish.

Tooling specifications and condition for the CNC milling operation, including tool type, geometry, coating (if any), usage hours, and inspection records.

 Worn or incorrect tooling can directly contribute to dimensional inaccuracies and poor surface finish. Inspection records can indicate tool wear patterns or damage.

Process parameters (speeds, feeds, depth of cut, coolant type/concentration) used during CNC milling for Lot # SS316L-Proto-007, ideally captured in a process sheet or traveler.

 Incorrect process parameters can lead to excessive tool wear, vibration, and ultimately, dimensional and surface finish problems. Need to compare against validated parameters.

Medium Priority Information

CNC machine maintenance records (recent preventative maintenance, repairs).

 Machine malfunctions or lack of maintenance could lead to vibrations or inaccuracies that impact dimensional control and surface finish.

Process Validation records for the CNC milling operation for this type of femoral component.

 If process validation exists, review to determine if the current process deviates from the validated parameters and if the validation included surface finish testing.

Control plan for the CNC milling process, including in-process inspection points and acceptance criteria.

 The control plan can indicate whether the in-process inspections were adequate to detect the non-conformance early and whether the acceptance criteria were appropriate.

Low Priority Information (Supporting Details)

Operator training records for the CNC milling machine and CMM inspection.

 While less likely, inadequate operator training could contribute to setup errors or incorrect inspection procedures. Verify personnel are qualified.

Environmental conditions in the CNC milling area (temperature, humidity).

 Extreme variations in temperature or humidity could (less likely) affect the dimensional stability of the material or the CNC machine.

The investigation should begin by gathering the high-priority data points to quickly assess the most likely root causes related to the CNC program, CMM accuracy, material, tooling, and process parameters. Further data collection may be required based on the initial findings.
