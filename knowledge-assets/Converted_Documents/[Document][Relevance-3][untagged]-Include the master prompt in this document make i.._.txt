THOUGHTS

The user wants a conceptual guide and prompt examples for a module titled "AI for SOP Consistency Checks."
I need to:
Define the Module's Purpose: Clearly state what this module aims to achieve for the manufacturing SMB audience.
Learning Objectives: Formulate 2-3 clear, measurable learning objectives.
Target Audience Reminder: Briefly reiterate who this is for (relevant roles in manufacturing SMBs).
Key Concepts: Explain why LLMs are suitable for this task and the benefits (consistency, identifying outdated info, time-saving).
Core Idea/Methodology:
How to prepare SOPs for LLM review.
What kind of LLM to use (readily accessible ones).
The iterative nature of the process.

Prompt Engineering - Best Practices for SOP Review:
Be specific in instructions.
Provide context (e.g., type of manufacturing, goal of the SOP).
Ask for specific types of inconsistencies (terminology, steps, safety, outdated references).
Iterative prompting (start broad, then refine).
Request output format (e.g., bullet points, table).

Example Prompts:
Prompt 1 (Internal Consistency): Check for consistent terminology, logical flow of steps, conflicting instructions within a single SOP.
Prompt 2 (Cross-SOP Consistency - if feasible with tool context window): Check for consistency between two related SOPs (e.g., setup and operation of the same machine). Self-correction: This might be harder with basic LLM interfaces unless combined. Focus on internal first, then maybe suggest a strategy for cross-SOP.
Prompt 3 (Outdated References): Check for references to old software, deprecated equipment, outdated safety standards, or old department names.
Prompt 4 (Clarity & Readability): Check for jargon, complex sentences, or areas that could be misunderstood by new operators.

Tools to Mention: Generative LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc. – keeping it general as per Fae's focus on accessible tools). Emphasize using tools they likely already have access to or can easily access.
Practical Application / Benefits for SMBs:
Improved training effectiveness.
Reduced errors due to inconsistent procedures.
Enhanced safety.
Easier SOP updates and maintenance.
Time savings for managers/engineers who would otherwise do this manually.

Considerations/Limitations:
LLMs are not perfect; human oversight is crucial.
Data privacy/confidentiality (if using cloud-based LLMs with proprietary SOPs). Suggest using anonymized data or on-premise solutions if available (though Fae focuses on low-cost/free, so cloud is more likely).
Context window limitations for very long SOPs.
The LLM doesn't "understand" the physical process, only the text.

Hands-on Activity Idea (if this were a full module outline): Provide a sample (short) SOP with deliberate inconsistencies and have participants use an LLM with a provided prompt to find them. For this request, just focus on the conceptual guide and prompts.
Tone and Voice: Practical, actionable, empowering, clear, concise, results-oriented, drawing on experience.
Let's structure the output:
Module Title: AI for SOP Consistency Checks
Introduction/Purpose: Briefly explain what this module covers and why it's important for manufacturing SMBs.
Learning Objectives: (Implicit in the guide, but good to state if it were a full outline)
Understand how LLMs can assist in reviewing SOPs.
Learn to craft effective prompts for identifying inconsistencies and outdated references.
Recognize the benefits and limitations of using AI for SOP review.

Why Use AI for SOP Review?
The Process: A Practical Approach
Preparing your SOPs
Choosing your LLM tool
Iterative review

Crafting Effective Prompts: Key Principles
Prompt Examples for SOP Review:
Checking for Internal Consistency
Identifying Outdated Information/References
Assessing Clarity and Readability
(Optional) Cross-Referencing between related SOPs (with caveats)

Important Considerations & Best Practices
Benefits for Your Manufacturing Operation
Next Steps (if part of a larger workshop)
This seems like a solid plan. I'll ensure the language is aligned with Fae Intelligence's brand voice and values, emphasizing Richard Snyder's practical experience where relevant. The focus is on using LLMs, not building them.
