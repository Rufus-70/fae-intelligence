The Non-Programmer's Playbook: Building Your Private AI Assistant for Business Automation with n8n and Local AI

Part 1: The Foundation - Understanding the Core Concepts

This first part of the report is designed to build a solid, non-technical understanding of the key technologies involved. It demystifies the jargon using simple analogies and focuses on the "why" behind each component, providing the necessary confidence to proceed to the practical setup.

Chapter 1: Bringing AI In-House: The Power of Local AI

The fundamental concept of running artificial intelligence on a personal computer is a game-changer for businesses of all sizes. This approach, known as "local AI," shifts the paradigm from using cloud-based services to operating a private, powerful AI system entirely on one's own hardware.

What is Local AI?

At its core, local AI means running sophisticated machine learning models directly on equipment that a business or individual owns and controls, such as a desktop computer or a dedicated server.1 This can be compared to the difference between ordering takeout and cooking a meal at home.
Cloud AI (Ordering Takeout): When using a service like ChatGPT, the request is sent over the internet to a massive data center owned by a large corporation. The AI model runs on their powerful computers, and the answer is sent back. This is convenient and requires no setup, but there is little control over the ingredients (how the AI is trained) or what happens in the kitchen (how the data is handled).2
Local AI (Cooking at Home): When running an AI model locally, the entire process happens on a personal computer. The data, the model, and the processing all stay "in the house." This provides complete control over the entire process, from the data used to the final output, ensuring nothing is shared without explicit permission.1

The "Why": Core Business Benefits

Choosing to run AI locally is more than a technical preference; it is a strategic business decision that offers tangible advantages in privacy, cost, and performance.
Unmatched Privacy & Data Control: This is the most compelling reason for a business to adopt local AI. Sensitive business data—such as customer lists, financial reports, proprietary algorithms, and strategic plans—never leaves the company's own hardware.5 This eliminates the risk of that data being used to train a third-party AI model, which could inadvertently benefit competitors or be used for unintended purposes.2 It represents a shift from simply
trusting a vendor's privacy policy to verifying data security through technical controls.2 For industries with strict data governance requirements, such as healthcare (HIPAA) or finance, this level of control is often essential for compliance.6
Significant Cost Savings: While setting up local AI may involve an initial consideration of hardware capabilities, it eliminates the recurring, usage-based fees associated with cloud AI services.6 Cloud providers often charge per "token" (a unit of text processed by the AI), and these costs can become unpredictable and substantial as a business scales its AI usage.5 With local AI, the primary costs are related to the hardware and electricity, which are more predictable and can lead to significant long-term savings.6
Performance & Offline Access: Because data does not need to travel over the internet to a remote server and back, local AI systems can offer significantly faster response times.1 This near-zero latency is critical for real-time applications. Furthermore, since the entire system runs on the local machine, it can function perfectly even without an internet connection, ensuring business processes can continue uninterrupted.1

The "How": A Reality Check on Hardware

The prospect of running powerful AI models locally naturally raises questions about hardware requirements. The performance of these models is heavily dependent on a component called the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). While a Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the general-purpose brain of a computer, a GPU is a specialized processor designed to handle many calculations at once, which is exactly what modern AI models need.1
The key metric for a GPU in the context of AI is its Video RAM (VRAM), which is a type of super-fast memory on the graphics card itself. The amount of VRAM determines the size and complexity of the AI model that can be run efficiently.1 However, it is a common misconception that this technology is only accessible to those with supercomputers. Many modern desktop computers, particularly those designed for gaming or creative work, are equipped with GPUs capable of running powerful open-source models.6 Furthermore, innovative software allows models to be split between the fast VRAM and the computer's main RAM, making it possible to run larger models even on systems with more modest GPUs, albeit with a performance trade-off.11
The following table provides a clear, at-a-glance summary that directly compares the local and cloud approaches on the factors that matter most to a business owner, translating technical differences into tangible business outcomes.

Chapter 2: n8n - Your Business's Automation Command Center

To truly unlock the power of a local AI model, it needs to be connected to the other applications and services that a business uses every day. This is where n8n comes in. It acts as the central command center, orchestrating tasks and moving data to create powerful, automated business processes.

What is n8n?

n8n (pronounced "en-eight-en") is a workflow automation tool.16 A useful analogy is to think of it as a set of digital Lego bricks. n8n provides a visual canvas and a vast collection of "bricks" called nodes. Each node represents a specific application (like Gmail or Google Sheets) or an action (like "read a file" or "filter data"). By visually connecting these nodes on the canvas, a user can build a "workflow," which is essentially a set of instructions that n8n follows to automate a task from start to finish. This process requires no programming knowledge, making it accessible to non-technical users.16

Core Concepts: Nodes and Workflows

Every automation built in n8n is composed of a few key concepts:
Workflows: A workflow is the complete, automated process. It's like a recipe that outlines every step required to get from a starting point to a final outcome.16
Nodes: These are the individual steps or building blocks within a workflow. Each node performs a single, specific function.16 There are two primary types of nodes:
Trigger Nodes: This is the starting pistol for a workflow. A trigger defines what event causes the automation to run. It could be a schedule (e.g., "run every day at 9 AM"), a new email arriving in an inbox, or a form submission on a website.16
Action Nodes: These nodes perform the work. They can fetch data from a database, send a message to Slack, update a spreadsheet, or, crucially, send a prompt to an AI model and receive its response.16
Connections: These are the lines drawn between nodes on the n8n canvas. They dictate the flow of data, ensuring that the output of one step becomes the input for the next, creating a logical sequence of operations.

Why n8n is the Perfect Partner for Local AI

While there are other automation tools available, n8n possesses a unique combination of features that make it the ideal choice for building a private, local AI system.
Self-Hosting Capability: Just like the AI model, n8n can be run entirely on a local computer or server.19 This is a critical feature. When both the AI model and the automation platform are self-hosted, they create a completely private "automation bubble." This ensures that sensitive data, from the initial trigger to the final action, never has to be sent over the internet to a third-party service. This maintains the full privacy and control benefits established by using a local AI model in the first place.
Flexibility and Extensibility: n8n is designed to be both powerful and accessible. Its visual, drag-and-drop interface is perfect for beginners, but it doesn't limit more advanced users. For those who are inclined to learn, n8n allows for the inclusion of small snippets of code (like JavaScript or Python) within workflows, meaning the platform can grow with a user's skills.19
Designed for AI Integration: The n8n platform has been developed with AI at its core. It includes a suite of dedicated nodes and features specifically designed to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs), making the process of integrating AI into any workflow seamless and intuitive.21 It can connect to both cloud-based AI services and, as will be demonstrated, locally hosted models.
By combining a self-hosted n8n instance with a local AI server, a business can create a fully sovereign automation stack. This architecture ensures that data integrity and privacy are maintained throughout the entire lifecycle of a business process, offering a level of security that is impossible to achieve when relying on a patchwork of cloud-based services.

Chapter 3: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) - What It Is and Why You Can Ignore It (For Now)

A specific point of confusion for many AI enthusiasts is the "Model Context Protocol," or MCP. Seeing this term can be an obstacle, as it sounds like a complex technical component that must be understood and configured. However, for the purpose of building business automations with n8n and a local AI, MCP can and should be set aside.

What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is an open-source standard introduced by the AI company Anthropic in late 2024.23 Technology writers have aptly dubbed it the "USB-C of AI apps".23 This analogy is very helpful. Just as a USB-C port provides a universal, standardized way for different devices and peripherals to connect and communicate, MCP aims to provide a universal "plug" for AI models to connect with external tools, data sources, and software environments.25
Before MCP, developers who wanted to connect an AI model to a new data source (like a company's internal documents or a customer relationship management system) had to build a custom, one-off connector for each and every integration. MCP was created to solve this problem by defining a standard language that any tool can use to "talk" to any AI model, and vice-versa.23

Who is it for?

This is the most critical point: MCP is a standard designed for software developers and platform builders, not for the end-users who build automations on those platforms.24 Companies like Wix (a website builder) or Sourcegraph (a code search tool) are implementing MCP
servers into their products. This allows AI applications, which act as MCP clients, to seamlessly interact with the data inside those platforms—for example, letting an AI edit a website's content on the fly.23
The user building a workflow in n8n is a consumer of these technologies, not a builder of the underlying infrastructure. The goal is not to create a new AI chat application from the ground up, but rather to connect two existing, powerful applications: n8n and a local AI server.

Why You Don't Need It

Fortunately, these two applications already know how to communicate with each other using a much more common and straightforward method called an Application Programming Interface, or API. An API is simply a set of rules and definitions that allows different software applications to talk to one another. This is the method that will be used in this guide to connect n8n to the local AI server.
The confusion around MCP is a perfect example of a common challenge for non-programmers exploring the AI space: it can be difficult to distinguish between the tools meant for developers who build the core platforms and the tools meant for users who build on top of them. Understanding this distinction is empowering. MCP is an exciting and important development for the future of AI, but for the practical goal of automating business processes with n8n, it is a piece of the puzzle that can be safely ignored.

Part 2: The Practical Guide - Building Your Local AI Powerhouse

This section serves as a hands-on workshop, providing a step-by-step walkthrough of the installation and setup process. Following these chapters will result in a fully functional local AI and automation system, ready for building practical business workflows.

Chapter 4: Setting Up Your Local AI Server: A Beginner's Guide to LM Studio

The first step in building a local AI system is to install the software that will manage and run the AI models on a personal computer. This software acts as a local server, making the AI model's capabilities available to other applications like n8n. While several excellent tools exist, such as Ollama 4, Jan 3, and LocalAI 27, this guide strongly recommends
LM Studio for beginners due to its intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface.28
LM Studio is designed to be accessible to users with no prior expertise in AI, making it an ideal starting point.28 It removes the need for command-line operations for basic setup, which can often be a significant hurdle for non-programmers.

Step-by-Step Installation and Setup of LM Studio

Download and Install LM Studio:
Navigate to the LM Studio website (lmstudio.ai).
Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).28
Run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.
Exploring the LM Studio Interface:
Upon opening LM Studio, there are three key sections to notice on the left-hand side menu:
Chat (💬 icon): This is where one can interact directly with the downloaded AI models, similar to using ChatGPT.
Model Discovery (🔍 icon): This is the search page for finding and downloading new open-source models from the Hugging Face repository, a massive hub for AI models.28
Local Server (<-> icon): This is the crucial section for our purposes. It allows the user to start a server that makes the local AI model accessible to other applications.
Downloading Your First AI Model:
Click on the Model Discovery (🔍) icon.
In the search bar at the top, type a model name. A good starting point is Phi-3-mini-instruct. This is a powerful yet relatively small model from Microsoft that performs well on consumer hardware.
A list of available model files will appear on the right. These files are typically in a format called GGUF. Think of GGUF as a specially compressed file type that makes it easy to run AI models efficiently on a wide range of computers.28
Look for a version with "Q4_K_M" in the name. This indicates a good balance between performance and size. Click the Download button next to it.
The model will begin downloading, and the progress can be monitored at the bottom of the application window.
Starting the Local Server:
Once the model has finished downloading, click on the Local Server (<->) icon from the left-hand menu.
At the top of this screen, there is a dropdown menu to Select a model to load. Click it and choose the Phi-3 model that was just downloaded.
After selecting the model, click the Start Server button.
The server will start, and the application will display log messages in the bottom panel, confirming that it is running and listening for requests. The server is now active and ready to be connected to n8n.
By following these steps, a user can go from having no local AI setup to running a fully operational AI server in a matter of minutes, all without touching a single line of code. This successful first step builds the momentum needed to tackle the rest of the integration.

Chapter 5: Setting Up Your Automation Hub: The n8n Self-hosted AI Starter Kit

With the AI server running, the next step is to set up the automation command center: n8n. To create a fully private system, n8n must be "self-hosted," meaning it runs on the same local computer. While this can be done manually, the n8n team has created an "easy button" that simplifies the process immensely: the n8n Self-hosted AI Starter Kit.29

The "Easy Button": What is the Starter Kit?

The Self-hosted AI Starter Kit is a pre-packaged, open-source template that bundles all the necessary components to get a local AI-ready version of n8n up and running with a single command.29 It uses a technology called Docker, which can be thought of as a way to create lightweight, self-contained "mini-computers" for applications to live in. This ensures that all the different pieces of software work together perfectly without conflicting with anything else on the host computer.
The kit includes several components, but the most important for this setup is n8n itself. It pre-configures all the complex networking and database connections that would otherwise be a significant challenge for a non-programmer.29

Step-by-Step Installation

Install Docker Desktop:
The starter kit requires Docker to run. Visit the official Docker website (docker.com) and download Docker Desktop for your operating system (Windows or Mac).
Follow the installation instructions. This may require a system restart. Once installed, ensure Docker Desktop is running.
Download and Run the Starter Kit:
This step involves using the command line (Terminal on Mac, or PowerShell/Command Prompt on Windows), but it only requires copying and pasting a single command.
Open the Terminal or PowerShell application.
Copy and paste the following command into the window and press Enter:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git && cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit && docker compose up

This command does three things: it downloads the starter kit files from the internet, navigates into the newly created folder, and then tells Docker to start all the bundled applications.
The first time this command is run, Docker will download all the necessary images, which may take several minutes. Subsequent starts will be much faster. A stream of log messages will appear in the window, indicating that the services are starting.
Access n8n:
Once the logs show that the n8n service is running, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5678.
The first time accessing this page, n8n will prompt the user to set up an owner account. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a username and password.
After completing this setup, a fully functional, self-hosted n8n instance is running locally. The use of the starter kit turns what could be a multi-step, error-prone configuration process into a single, reliable command, effectively removing one of the biggest technical barriers to entry.

Chapter 6: Making the Connection: Linking n8n to LM Studio

With both the local AI server (LM Studio) and the automation hub (n8n) running, the final step in building the core system is to connect them. This is achieved using an API, which acts as a messenger between the two applications.

What is an API?

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a standardized way for different software programs to communicate. A simple analogy is that of a waiter in a restaurant.
The customer (n8n) wants to order food.
The customer gives their order to the waiter (the API call).
The waiter takes the order to the kitchen (LM Studio), which is a black box to the customer.
The kitchen prepares the food (the AI generates a response).
The waiter brings the finished dish back to the customer.
The customer doesn't need to know how the kitchen works; they only need to know how to talk to the waiter. Similarly, n8n doesn't need to know the inner workings of the AI model; it just needs to know how to send a request to the LM Studio server's API.

The "OpenAI-Compatible" Secret

A key feature of LM Studio is that its local server is "OpenAI-compatible".31 This means it intentionally mimics the API of OpenAI's famous services like ChatGPT. This is a massive advantage because n8n has a powerful, pre-built node specifically for interacting with OpenAI. By using this node, the connection process becomes incredibly simple. This is a crucial piece of "insider knowledge" that can save hours of frustration, as a beginner might otherwise search in vain for a dedicated "LM Studio" node in n8n.33

Step-by-Step Guide to Connecting n8n and LM Studio

Create a New Workflow in n8n:
In the n8n interface (at http://localhost:5678), click the "Create" button to start a new, blank workflow.
Add the OpenAI Chat Model Node:
Click the + icon on the canvas to add a new node.
In the search box, type OpenAI and select the OpenAI Chat Model node from the list.
Configure the Credentials:
In the OpenAI Chat Model node's settings panel on the right, click on the Credential dropdown menu and select Create New.
A new window will pop up for creating the credential. This is where the connection to the local server is defined.
Name: Give the credential a memorable name, such as Local LM Studio.
API Key: For a local connection, this is not needed. Type any random text, such as 123 or notneeded.31
Base URL: This is the most important setting. Click the toggle for Use Base URL and enter the following special address into the field: http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1.31
The address host.docker.internal is a special name that allows the n8n application (running inside a Docker container) to find and communicate with services running on the main host computer (where LM Studio is running).
:1234 is the default port number that the LM Studio server uses.
Click the Save button to create the credential.
Test the Connection:
Back in the OpenAI Chat Model node's settings, the newly created Local LM Studio credential should be selected.
In the Model dropdown, click the refresh icon. If the connection is successful, the name of the model loaded in LM Studio (e.g., microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf) should appear in the list.
Select the model from the list.
The connection is now complete. The n8n automation platform is successfully linked to the private, local AI server. The following cheatsheet summarizes the connection details for the most common local AI servers.

Part 3: Putting It All to Work - Real-World Business Automation

With the system built and connected, this section demonstrates its practical value. The following chapters provide self-contained tutorials for three real-world business workflows. These examples are designed to deliver immediate value and teach the fundamental patterns of AI automation, which can then be adapted to countless other business needs.

Chapter 7: Your First Workflow: Automated Daily Email Summaries

The first project should be simple, reliable, and provide immediate, tangible value. An automated daily email summary fits this description perfectly. It tackles the universal business problem of email overload and provides a clear "win" that builds confidence in the new system. This workflow will run automatically each morning, read new emails, use the local AI to summarize them, and deliver a concise digest.

Workflow Logic

Trigger: The workflow will start automatically at a set time every day.
Fetch Emails: It will connect to an email account and retrieve all messages received in the last 24 hours.
Summarize with AI: The content of these emails will be sent to the local AI model with a prompt asking for a summary of key points and action items.
Notify: The AI-generated summary will be sent to a specified email address or a Slack channel.

Building the Workflow Step-by-Step

Step 1: Set the Trigger
In a new n8n workflow, delete the default "Start" node.
Click the + button and add a Schedule node (previously known as Cron node).36
In the node's settings, set the Mode to Every Day.
Set the Hour to 8 to have it run at 8:00 AM.
Set the Timezone to the appropriate local timezone.
Step 2: Fetch Emails
Click the + icon connected to the Schedule node and add a Gmail node (or an IMAP Server node for other email providers).
Credential: Create a new credential to connect to the desired Google account. This will require signing in to Google and authorizing n8n to access emails.18
Resource: Set to Message.
Operation: Set to Get Many.
Return All: Enable this option.
Filters: Click Add Filter and select After. In the value field, use an n8n expression to get emails from the last 24 hours. Click the gears icon, select Add Expression, and enter: {{ $now.minus({days: 1}) }}.
Step 3: Summarize with Local AI
Connect an OpenAI Chat Model node to the Gmail node.
Credential: Select the Local LM Studio credential created in the previous part.
Model: Choose the locally hosted model from the dropdown.
Text: This is where the prompt is crafted. Click Add Expression and enter the following:
Summarize the key points and required actions from the following email content. Format your response as a clear, scannable bulleted list.

Email Content:
{{ $json.snippet }}

This prompt tells the AI its task and then uses the expression {{ $json.snippet }} to dynamically insert the content of each email passed from the previous node.37
Step 4: Send the Summary Notification
Connect a Send Email node to the AI node.
Credential: Set up SMTP credentials for the email service that will send the notification.
To Address: Enter the recipient's email address.
Subject: Daily Email Summary for {{ $now.toFormat('DDDD') }}
Text: In the body of the email, use an expression to insert the AI's response. Click Add Expression and select the output from the OpenAI node: {{ $('OpenAI Chat Model').item.json.choices.message.content }}. This expression navigates the data structure from the AI node to find the generated text.
Activate the Workflow
Click the toggle switch in the top right corner of the screen from Inactive to Active.
The workflow is now live. Every morning at 8:00 AM, it will automatically execute, providing a valuable summary and demonstrating the power of the private automation system.

Chapter 8: Level Up: Intelligent Customer Reply Automation

This next workflow tackles a more complex and interactive business problem: drafting replies to customer inquiries. This introduces a critical concept for making AI reliable in a business context: providing it with a trusted source of information to prevent it from "hallucinating" or inventing incorrect answers.

Workflow Logic

Trigger: The workflow will start immediately when a new email arrives in a designated support or info inbox.
Provide Context (Simplified RAG): The workflow will read a local text file containing the company's Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). This file acts as the AI's "cheat sheet."
Generate Draft: The AI will be given the customer's question and the content of the FAQ file. It will be instructed to answer the question only using information from the provided text.
Human in the Loop: The AI-generated draft reply will be sent to an internal team member for review and approval before it is sent to the customer. This step is crucial for building trust and ensuring quality control.
This technique is a simplified version of a powerful AI pattern called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In essence, before the AI generates an answer, it first retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base. This grounds the AI's response in factual, pre-approved data, making it vastly more reliable for business use cases.39

Building the Workflow Step-by-Step

Step 1: Create the FAQ File
On the local computer, create a simple text file named faq.txt.
Populate this file with common question-and-answer pairs. For example:
Q: What are your business hours?
A: We are open Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM.

Q: What is your return policy?
A: We accept returns within 30 days of purchase for a full refund.

Step 2: Set the Trigger
In a new n8n workflow, add a Gmail Trigger node (or Email Trigger (IMAP)).
Configure the credentials and specify the inbox to monitor (e.g., support@yourbusiness.com).
Step 3: Read the FAQ File
Connect a Read File from Disk node. This node requires a self-hosted n8n instance to access the local filesystem.41
File Path: Provide the full path to the faq.txt file created in Step 1. Note: Because n8n is running in Docker, the local file path needs to be accessible from within the container. The Self-hosted AI Starter Kit creates a shared folder for this purpose.
Step 4: Generate the Draft Reply with Context
Connect an OpenAI Chat Model node.
Credential: Select the Local LM Studio credential.
Text: This prompt is more complex and crucial for ensuring accuracy. Use an expression to combine the customer's email and the FAQ content:
You are a helpful and professional customer support assistant. Using ONLY the information provided in the 'FAQ Content' section below, please answer the 'Customer Question'.

If the answer to the question is not found in the FAQ Content, you MUST respond with exactly this phrase: "Thank you for your question. I don't have that information available, but I have forwarded your request to a human team member who will get back to you shortly."

---
FAQ Content:
{{ $('Read File from Disk').item.binary.data }}
---
Customer Question:
{{ $('Gmail Trigger').item.json.text }}
---

This prompt uses expressions to pull in the text from the FAQ file and the body of the customer's email. The strict instructions prevent the AI from guessing.
Step 5: Human Approval Step
Connect a Send Email node.
To Address: Enter an internal email address (e.g., manager@yourbusiness.com).
Subject: Approval Needed: AI Draft Reply for Customer {{ $('Gmail Trigger').item.json.from.email }}
Text: Include both the original question and the AI's drafted reply for easy review:
Please review the following AI-drafted response.

Original Customer Email:
{{ $('Gmail Trigger').item.json.text }}

---
AI Drafted Reply:
{{ $('OpenAI Chat Model').item.json.choices.message.content }}
---

This workflow introduces a more advanced and responsible way to use AI for customer interactions. It teaches the critical principle of grounding AI in facts and maintaining human oversight, which are essential for deploying AI in a real business environment.

Chapter 9: Supercharge Your Data: Extracting Information from Invoices into a Spreadsheet

This final tutorial demonstrates one of the most powerful capabilities of modern AI: understanding unstructured data (like the text in a PDF invoice) and transforming it into structured data (like rows in a spreadsheet). This automates tedious manual data entry, saving significant time and reducing human error.

Workflow Logic

Trigger: The workflow will watch a specific folder on the computer and start automatically whenever a new PDF file is added.
Extract Text: It will read the new PDF file and extract all the raw text from it.
AI Data Extraction: The raw text will be sent to the local AI with a highly specific prompt, instructing it to find key pieces of information (like invoice number, amount, and due date) and return them in a clean, machine-readable format.
Add to Spreadsheet: The structured data from the AI will be added as a new row in a designated Google Sheet.
The key skill in this workflow is "structured prompting." By telling the AI not just what to find but also the exact format for its output, its response becomes reliable and can be used directly by subsequent nodes without complex data cleaning.42

Building the Workflow Step-by-Step

Step 1: Set Up the Trigger Folder and Spreadsheet
On the local computer, create a folder named Invoices_To_Process.
In Google Drive, create a new Google Sheet named Invoice Data. Add column headers: Invoice Number, Company Name, Total Amount, Due Date, File Name.
Step 2: Trigger on New File
In a new n8n workflow, add a Local File Trigger node. This node is only available on self-hosted n8n instances.41
Path: Enter the full path to the Invoices_To_Process folder.
Event: Select File Created.
Step 3: Extract Text from the PDF
Connect an Extract From File node to the trigger.43
The node will automatically use the binary data passed from the trigger. The default settings are sufficient.
Step 4: AI-Powered Data Extraction
Connect an OpenAI Chat Model node.
Credential: Select Local LM Studio.
Text: This prompt is the core of the workflow. It must be very precise.
From the following raw text of an invoice, extract the Invoice Number, the Company Name of the issuer, the final Total Amount, and the Due Date.

Provide the output ONLY in this exact JSON format. Do not add any other text, explanations, or pleasantries.

{"invoice_number": "...", "company_name": "...", "total_amount":..., "due_date": "..."}

---
Invoice Text:
{{ $('Extract From File').item.json.text }}
---

This prompt forces the AI to act as a data conversion tool, returning a clean JSON object that n8n can easily understand.
Step 5: Add Data to Google Sheets
Connect a Google Sheets node.
Credential: Create a new credential to connect to the Google account.
Operation: Select Append or Update Rows.
Spreadsheet: Select the Invoice Data sheet.
Sheet Name: Select the correct sheet within the file.
Columns to Match On: Leave this blank to always append new rows.
Columns: Map the data from the AI's JSON output to the spreadsheet columns.
Click Add Column.
For the Invoice Number column, add an expression that points to the AI's output: {{ JSON.parse($('OpenAI Chat Model').item.json.choices.message.content).invoice_number }}.
Repeat this process for the other columns, changing the final part of the expression (e.g., .company_name, .total_amount). The JSON.parse() function is used to tell n8n to treat the AI's text output as structured JSON data.
This workflow showcases a transformative use case for local AI. By turning unstructured documents into structured, actionable data, it opens the door to automating a vast range of data entry and processing tasks that were previously manual and time-consuming.

Conclusion: The Start of Your AI Automation Journey

By following this guide, a motivated business professional can successfully overcome the initial technical hurdles and build a powerful, private, and cost-effective AI automation system. The journey from conceptual confusion to a functioning system demonstrates that these advanced technologies are no longer the exclusive domain of programmers. The system that has been built—combining a local AI server with a self-hosted automation platform—is a testament to the power of modern, accessible tools.
