start Up
Navigate to your project's root directory (if you're not already there):

 cd /home/rosie/projects/faes-web

Navigate into the functions subdirectory:

 cd functions

Create a Python virtual environment named venv (if it doesn't exist or if you want to refresh it, you can remove an old one first with rm -rf venv):

 python3 -m venv venv
 (Use python3.13 if that's your specific Python version for this project)

Activate this virtual environment:

 source venv/bin/activate
 Your terminal prompt should change to indicate (venv).

Upgrade pip within this active virtual environment:

 python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
 (Use python3.13 if consistent)

Install the Python dependencies required by your functions:

 python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
 (Use python3.13 if consistent)

Deactivate the functions-specific virtual environment:

 deactivate

Navigate back to your project's root directory:

 cd ..

Now, from the project root directory (/home/rosie/projects/faes-web/), start all necessary Firebase emulators:


 firebase emulators:start --only auth,firestore,storage,functions
