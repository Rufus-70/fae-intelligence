# Tool: BMAD-METHOD

## Description
BMAD-METHOD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI Driven Development) is an open-source framework designed to transform software development by integrating a team of specialized AI agents into the agile workflow. It operates on the principle of an "Orchestrator" agent managing other agents with specific roles (e.g., Product Manager, Architect, Developer, QA). The framework provides a structured set of prompts, templates, and workflows that can be installed directly into a developer's project and used within their IDE.

## Primary Capabilities
- **Multi-Agent System:** Simulates a full development team with distinct AI personas for different stages of a project.
- **IDE Integration:** Designed to work within popular developer environments like Cursor and Claude Code, allowing AI interaction in-context with the codebase.
- **Automated Installation & Upgrades:** A CLI installer (`npx bmad-method install`) simplifies setup and maintenance.
- **Web-Based Quick Start:** Offers "web bundles" as single text files that can be uploaded to platforms like Gemini to run the agent team in a web UI without local installation.
- **Document Processing:** Includes tasks for migrating and sharding large project documents (like PRDs and architecture specs) into formats easily consumed by AI agents.
