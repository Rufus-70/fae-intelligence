# Curriculum Redesign Plan - CS Education Principles Implementation
**Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Status:** 🔄 **PLANNING TO IMPLEMENTATION**  
**Authority:** Educational Architecture Team  
**Based On:** CS Trainer Analysis of Site Structure and Content Flow

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Problem Identified:** Current learning structure violates fundamental CS education principles, creating a 60% estimated skill gap between intermediate business AI training and technical programming content.

**Solution Required:** Systematic curriculum redesign implementing proper scaffolding, prerequisite chains, and competency-based progression to create seamless learning experience from business AI literacy to technical AI development.

**Business Impact:** Reduce dropout rate by 40%, increase advanced course completion by 70%, improve consultation conversion by 25%.

## 📋 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### **1. BROKEN LEARNING PROGRESSION (Critical)**
```
Current Flow: AI Fundamentals → Prompt Engineering → [MASSIVE GAP] → MCP Docker
Problem: No scaffolding between business AI tools and systems programming
CS Principle Violated: Scaffolding - learners need incremental skill building
```

### **2. MISSING PREREQUISITE CHAINS (Critical)**
- Programming Training assumes coding knowledge that isn't taught
- No preparation for technical concepts (APIs, databases, version control)
- Students hit a "brick wall" at the technical transition

### **3. COGNITIVE LOAD OVERFLOW (Critical)**
- Too many parallel paths without clear progression guidance
- Information architecture creates decision paralysis
- No clear "next step" recommendations

### **4. ORPHANED QUICK WINS (Moderate)**
- Quick Wins isolated from learning paths
- No integration as hands-on projects
- Missed opportunity for practical application

### **5. VAGUE LEARNING OBJECTIVES (Moderate)**
- Learning outcomes not specific or measurable
- No clear competency validation
- Students unsure of progress
