# Solution: Simplified CLI Installer for Dev Tools

## Description
This solution involves providing a single, interactive command-line interface (CLI) installer to manage the setup and maintenance of a complex tool or framework. The BMAD-METHOD v4 installer, executed with `npx bmad-method install`, is a prime example. It guides the user through the process, automatically detects existing installations for upgrades, handles file copying and configuration, backs up modified files, and sets up integration for specific IDEs.

## Primary Use Cases
- **Use Case 1 (First-Time Setup):** A developer runs a single command in their project terminal to install and configure all necessary components of a framework like BMAD-METHOD.
- **Use Case 2 (Project Upgrades):** When a new version of the framework is released, the developer can run the exact same install command, which detects the existing version and performs a safe, non-breaking upgrade (00:57, 01:16).

## Notes
The principle here is highly valuable for any SMB adopting new software. A guided, automated installer dramatically reduces the technical skill and time required for setup, making technology more accessible and practical. Fae Intelligence should favor tools that offer this level of user-friendly onboarding.
