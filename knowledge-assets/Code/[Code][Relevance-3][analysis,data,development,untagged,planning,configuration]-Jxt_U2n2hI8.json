A 30-year veteran knows that a technically 'good' niche might be filled with clients who are difficult to work with or don't value digital marketing.",

The ultimate goal is not to manage the site for a monthly fee, but to sell the entire ranking, lead-generating website as a complete digital asset to a client business for a one-time fee, cited to be $10,000 or more."
