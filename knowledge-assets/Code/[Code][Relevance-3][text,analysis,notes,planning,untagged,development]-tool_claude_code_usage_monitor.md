# Tool: Claude Code Usage Monitor

## Description
The Claude Code Usage Monitor is an open-source tool that provides a real-time, in-terminal dashboard for tracking the usage and cost of Anthropic's Claude Code. It gives developers immediate visibility into how their interactions are affecting their subscription limits and potential costs. The tool displays progress bars for cost usage, token usage, and message usage, and predicts when the user might run out of tokens at their current rate.

## Primary Capabilities
- **Real-time Metrics:** Continuously updates usage statistics during an active Claude Code session.
- **Multi-Metric Tracking:** Monitors cost, total tokens, and message counts simultaneously.
- **Limit Awareness:** Understands subscription plan limits (e.g., the 5-hour reset window for the Pro plan) and displays time remaining.
- **Predictive Analysis:** Calculates a "burn rate" and predicts the time at which the user will exhaust their token limit.

## Notes
A must-have utility for any individual or team using Claude Code, especially for SMBs where every dollar counts. It shifts cost management from a reactive, end-of-month process to a proactive, in-the-moment activity.
