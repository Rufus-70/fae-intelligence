# Skill Gap Analysis Project
**Date Created:** July 1, 2025  
**Project ID:** CURR-AUDIT-02  
**Status:** 🔄 **PLANNED** - Awaiting Learning Objective Audit Completion  
**Duration:** 2 Weeks (July 15-28, 2025)  
**Owner:** Educational Design Team  
**Prerequisite:** Learning Objective Audit (CURR-AUDIT-01)

## 🎯 Project Goals

**Primary Objective:** Identify and quantify knowledge gaps between modules that cause learning failure

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Prerequisite knowledge mapped for every module
- [ ] Critical skill gaps identified and measured (>30% jumps flagged)
- [ ] Bridge module curriculum designed for major gaps
- [ ] Dropout risk assessment completed for each transition

## 📋 Current State Analysis

### **Known Critical Issues:**
1. **300% Knowledge Jump:** Claude ChatGPT Projects → MCP Docker Training
2. **Hidden Prerequisites:** Programming modules assume untaught knowledge
3. **Cognitive Leaps:** No scaffolding between business and technical content
4. **Orphaned Prerequisites:** Skills needed but taught nowhere

### **Estimated Impact:**
- **60-80% dropout rate** at technical transition points
- **Student frustration** leading to negative brand experience
- **Consultation conversion loss** from incomplete learning paths

## 🔍 Analysis Framework

### **Skill Gap Measurement Method:**
```
FOR EACH MODULE TRANSITION:
├── Prerequisite Knowledge Audit
├── Knowledge Jump Calculation (% increase)
├── Missing Bridge Content Identification
├── Dropout Risk Assessment
└── Bridge Module Requirements Definition
```

### **Knowledge Dependency Mapping:**
```
EXAMPLE: MCP Docker Training Analysis

├── Technical Prerequisites: [Skills not taught anywhere]
└── Cognitive Prerequisites: [Thinking patterns required]

KNOWLEDGE PROVIDED BY MODULE A:
├── Explicit Learning: [What we actually teach]
├── Practice Applications: [Skills they practice]
└── Confidence Level: [How prepared they feel]

GAP ANALYSIS:
├── Knowledge Jump Size: [Percentage increase]
├── Missing Prerequisites: [Skills needed but not taught]
├── Difficulty Rating: [Easy/Medium/Hard/Critical]
└── Estimated Dropout Risk: [Percentage]

BRIDGE REQUIREMENTS:
├── Concepts to Introduce: [New knowledge needed]
├── Skills to Practice: [Hands-on requirements]
├── Duration Estimate: [Time needed to bridge gap]
└── Assessment Method: [How to validate readiness]
```

## 📅 Execution Timeline

### **Week 1 (July 15-21, 2025):**
- [ ] **Day 1:** Map prerequisites for all beginner → intermediate transitions
- [ ] **Day 2:** Map prerequisites for all intermediate → advanced transitions  
- [ ] **Day 3:** Map prerequisites for advanced → programming transitions
- [ ] **Day 4:** Calculate knowledge jump sizes and identify critical gaps
- [ ] **Day 5:** Document missing bridge content requirements

### **Week 2 (July 22-28, 2025):**
- [ ] **Day 1:** Design bridge module curriculum for critical gaps
- [ ] **Day 2:** Design bridge module curriculum for moderate gaps
- [ ] **Day 3:** Create dropout risk assessment model
- [ ] **Day 4:** Validate findings with user journey data (if available)
- [ ] **Day 5:** Compile comprehensive gap analysis report

## 🚨 Critical Gap Priorities

### **Priority 1: Critical Gaps (>50% knowledge jump)**
- **Business AI → Technical Implementation**
- **Tool Usage → Programming Concepts**
- **Beginner → Advanced Programming**

### **Priority 2: Major Gaps (30-50% knowledge jump)**
- **AI Fundamentals → Prompt Engineering**
- **Engineering Alignment → Programming Training**
- **Individual Tools → System Integration**

### **Priority 3: Minor Gaps (10-30% knowledge jump)**
- **Within-level module progressions**
- **Concept reinforcement needs**
- **Practice opportunity gaps**

## 📈 Success Metrics

### **Quantitative Targets:**
- **100% Transition Coverage:** Every module-to-module transition analyzed
- **Gap Quantification:** Knowledge jumps measured and categorized
- **Bridge Module Design:** Curriculum specs for closing critical gaps
- **Risk Assessment:** Dropout probability calculated for each transition

### **Quality Indicators:**
- **Systematic Coverage:** No transitions overlooked
- **Realistic Assessment:** Bridge requirements achievable
- **Actionable Insights:** Clear next steps for content development
- **Data-Driven:** Decisions based on measurement, not assumptions
