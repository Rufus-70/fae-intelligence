      "Before installing any tracking pixel, Richard Snyder's 30+ years of experience would scream 'Compliance First!'. The video barely touches on the immense legal and ethical implications (GDPR, CCPA). An operational leader must consult a lawyer, update the website's privacy policy to be transparent about this specific tracking, and implement a clear consent mechanism. Pitching this service without this is a massive liability.",
      "The 'AI-generated copy' sounds great, but an experienced manager knows to 'trust but verify.' A mandatory human review step is missing. The AI might misinterpret a lead's business and generate embarrassing or nonsensical copy, burning a valuable lead and damaging brand reputation. A small, supervised test batch is operationally essential before full rollout.",
      "Data quality is a major operational concern. The leads from this tool depend on third-party data brokers, which can be inaccurate. An operational process must be added to validate the lead data. For B2B, this could be cross-referencing with LinkedIn. Sending emails to a bad list harms deliverability and can get a domain blacklisted."

This is presented as a high-value service that marketing agencies can offer to their clients or that any SMB can use to create a new, highly-qualified lead pipeline from their existing website traffic."
