It empowers SMBs by turning their greatest asset, their operational experience, into a competitive advantage in the AI era. This aligns with Fae's focus on practical, results-oriented solutions and provides a clear, actionable strategy to offer clients.",
    "generalVideoSummary": "The speaker synthesizes learnings from major AI conferences, arguing that the primary opportunity for startups and SMBs is not to compete with big tech on general models, but to build 'Vertical AI Agents'\u2014specialized AIs for niche industries. Using the 'Three Waves of SaaS' as an analogy, the video predicts that these vertical agents represent a market potentially 10x larger than vertical SaaS because they replace both software and the human labor operating it. Key skills for this new 'Agent Engineer' role are identified as advanced Prompt Engineering and creating robust Evaluation frameworks ('Evals'). The video concludes by offering a 5-step process for decomposing any business workflow for automation."
