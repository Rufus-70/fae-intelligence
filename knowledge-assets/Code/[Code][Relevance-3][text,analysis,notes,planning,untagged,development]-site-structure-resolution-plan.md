# Fae Intelligence - Site Structure Resolution Plan

## 🎯 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Status:** ✅ **ACTUAL FILE STRUCTURE IS CORRECT**  
**Issue:** Documentation inconsistencies causing confusion  
**Solution:** Standardize documentation and clean up redundant directories  

---

## 📋 **PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE FIXES (Priority 1)**

### **1A. Remove Redundant Directory**
**Issue:** Empty `/resources/mcp-docker/` directory exists  
**Action:** Delete redundant directory  
**Rationale:** MCP Docker training already exists at `/resources/programming-training/mcp-docker-guide/`

**✅ EXECUTE:**
```bash
# Remove empty redundant directory
rm -rf /home/rosie/projects/fae-intelligence/src/app/resources/mcp-docker/
```

### **1B. Verify All File Links Work**
**Issue:** Ensure all internal links point to correct locations  
**Action:** Audit all training path pages for correct URLs
