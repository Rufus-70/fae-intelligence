# Customer Pain Point: Unpredictable AI Usage Costs

## Description
This pain point reflects the challenge businesses, especially SMBs, face in managing and predicting the operational costs of using AI development tools. Subscription models for services like Cursor (04:41) are moving towards usage-based limits, and direct API access has always been pay-as-you-go. Without real-time monitoring, developers can quickly consume their token/message allowance, leading to surprise bills or a halt in productivity.

## Manifestations & Examples
- **Example 1:** A startup on a Pro plan hits their monthly message limit two weeks into the month, forcing them to either stop using the AI or switch to a more expensive pay-as-you-go model.
- **Example 2:** A freelance developer is unable to accurately quote a project because they cannot predict the AI tool costs involved in the work.
- **Example 3:** A business owner approves the use of an AI tool but has no way to track its consumption until the invoice arrives at the end of the month.
