# Customer Pain Point: Inefficient AI Code Assistant Performance
## Description
This pain point describes the degradation in performance and accuracy of AI coding assistants when they operate on large or complex codebases. The root cause, as explained in the video, is "context window clutter" (00:22). The AI is forced to read and process thousands of lines of code that are irrelevant to the specific task, making it slower, more expensive, and more error-prone. The speaker estimates that this can lead to the tool working at only 30% of its potential (00:03).
## Manifestations & Examples
- **Example 1:** A developer asks the AI to fix a bug in a specific component, but the AI spends a long time (and many tokens) reading unrelated files before providing a solution, if it finds one at all.
- **Example 2:** An AI assistant provides code that breaks other parts of the application because it missed a key dependency in a file it didn't prioritize correctly.
- **Example 3:** A small dev shop sees its monthly AI bill skyrocket because every simple query requires the model to process a massive amount of context from their entire project.

## Notes
Fae Intelligence can frame this as "getting the full ROI from your AI tools." Most businesses are paying for the full power of models like Claude but are handicapped by inefficient context management. This is a classic operational inefficiency problem applied to a modern tech stack.
