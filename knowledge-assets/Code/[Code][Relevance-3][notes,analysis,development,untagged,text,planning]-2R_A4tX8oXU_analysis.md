## Business Processes & Implementation Guides
### Process 1: Structured Prompt Engineering for High-Quality AI Outputs
**Description:** A systematic method for creating and refining instructions (prompts) for Generative AI models. The goal is to move from generic or 'okay' results to highly specific, relevant, and better-quality outputs for tasks like content creation, problem-solving, and analysis.

**Target Audience:**
- Business Professionals using AI tools
- Marketers and Content Creators
- Students and Researchers
- Entrepreneurs and SMB Owners

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Apply the 'Tiny Crabs Ride Enormous Iguanas' (TCRI) Framework for Initial Prompting.**
   - Details: This framework structures your initial request to the AI. T: Define a clear TASK (What should the AI do?). C: Provide relevant CONTEXT (Who is this for? What's the background?). R: Offer RESOURCES/REFERENCES (Give it examples to emulate). E: EVALUATE the result. I: ITERATE on the prompt based on the evaluation.
   - Tools: ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude
   - Time/Effort: 5-15 minutes per task

2. **Use Specific Techniques to Enhance the Prompt.**
   - Details: Within the TCRI framework, explicitly add a Persona (e.g., 'Act as an expert IG influencer'), specify the desired Output Format (e.g., 'start with a fun fact, end with three hashtags'), and provide examples for the AI to learn from.
   - Time/Effort: Part of initial prompting

3. **Apply the 'Ramen Saves Tragic Idiots' (RSTI) Framework for Refining Weak Outputs.**
   - Details: If the initial result isn't good enough, use this debugging framework. R: REVISIT the previous TCRI mnemonic. S: SEPARATE a long prompt into shorter, clearer sentences. T: TRY different phrasing (e.g., 'write a story' instead of 'write a speech'). I: INTRODUCE constraints to narrow the focus (e.g., 'only use country music from the 90s').
   - Time/Effort: Ongoing iteration

**Quantitative Benefits:**
- Time Saved: Reduces revision cycles by 50-80% - By getting a high-quality result on the first or second try, you eliminate the time wasted on multiple poor attempts and extensive manual editing.
**Qualitative Benefits:**
- Dramatically improves the quality and relevance of AI-generated content.
- Reduces frustration when interacting with AI tools.
- Builds a foundational skill applicable to all advanced AI applications.
- Empowers users to achieve their desired outcome efficiently.

**Business Impact:**
Strategic Impact:
- Increased productivity
- More effective use of AI investment
- Higher quality marketing and communication outputs
- Competitive advantage through skill enhancement
KPIs Affected:
- Content Creation Speed
- Marketing Campaign ROI
- Employee Productivity
- First-draft quality metrics

**LinkedIn Post Hook:** Prompting is the most valuable skill of 2025. It's not just about asking questions; it's about providing structured instructions. I learned two key frameworks (TCRI and RSTI) that dramatically improved the quality of my AI outputs. Here's a breakdown of the first one:

## Knowledge Graph Entities & Relationships
### Identified Entities
- **Prompt Engineering** (Concept): The process of providing specific instructions to a Generative AI tool to receive new information or achieve a desired outcome on a task. It is described as the single highest ROI skill to learn.
- **Generative AI (GenAI)** (Concept): A specific subset of AI that can generate new content, such as text, images, audio, video, and code.
- **Large Language Model (LLM)** (Technology): A type of Generative AI model that can process text and output text. Examples include OpenAI's GPT family, Google's Gemini family, and Anthropic's Claude models.
- **AI Agents** (Concept): Software systems that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks on behalf of users. They are composed of a Model, Tools, Knowledge/Memory, Audio/Speech, Guardrails, and Orchestration.
- **Vibe Coding** (Concept): A new kind of coding where a developer gives in to the 'vibes' and lets LLMs handle most of the implementation details, focusing on high-level direction rather than line-by-line coding.
- **TCRI Framework** (BusinessStrategy): A mnemonic framework for prompting: Task, Context, Resources, Evaluate, Iterate. It is used for crafting a comprehensive initial prompt.
- **RSTI Framework** (BusinessStrategy): A mnemonic framework for refining weak AI outputs: Revisit (previous framework), Separate sentences, Try different phrasing, Introduce constraints.

### Key Relationships
- Prompt Engineering --USES_FRAMEWORK--> TCRI Framework: The TCRI framework is presented as a method for effective prompt engineering.
- Generative AI (GenAI) --IS_A_SUBSET_OF--> Artificial Intelligence: The video's concentric circles diagram shows Generative AI as a subset of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and overall Artificial Intelligence.
- AI Agents --IS_COMPOSED_OF--> LLM: The AI model (often an LLM) is listed as the core component of an AI agent, providing the intelligence.
- Vibe Coding --LEVERAGES--> LLM: The concept of vibe coding is possible because LLMs are getting so good at writing and fixing code on their own.
- RSTI Framework --IS_USED_TO_REFINE_RESULTS_OF--> TCRI Framework: The RSTI framework is presented as the next step when the initial prompt created with TCRI doesn't produce the desired outcome.

## Fae Intelligence Strategic Analysis
### Operational Wisdom Integration
- The 'TCRI' prompt framework is a perfect real-world business analogy. Richard Snyder would frame it as a 'Creative Brief'. For 30 years, giving any employee a new 'Task' without proper 'Context' and 'Resources' (examples of good work) leads to failure. The 'Evaluate/Iterate' loop is simply the day-to-day process of management and coaching. Teaching SMBs this framework is teaching them how to manage a very smart, very literal junior employee.
- The 'RSTI' debugging framework mirrors classic process improvement. When a process (the prompt) fails, the first step is to 'Revisit' the original plan (the TCRI brief). If it's too complex, 'Separate' it into smaller steps. Operational wisdom values clarity and simplicity in instructions.
- The concept of 'Vibe Coding' without understanding fundamentals like version control is operationally reckless. An experienced leader would stress that while AI can accelerate work, it doesn't remove the need for foundational business practices like backups and checkpoints. Losing two weeks of work because you didn't have a simple checkpoint system is an unforced error Fae Intelligence can help SMBs avoid.

### AI Application Opportunities
- The most immediate AI application is for SMBs to use the TCRI and RSTI frameworks to automate marketing copy, social media calendars, and business email drafts. This is a low-cost, high-ROI activity that saves significant time.
- The discussion on AI agents provides a forward-looking angle. SMBs should start thinking about which of their repetitive, software-based tasks (e.g., creating customer service tickets, updating their CRM, scheduling appointments) could be handed off to a future AI agent.
- Multimodal AI can be used by SMBs for simple graphic design. A small business can upload their logo and a product photo and ask the AI to 'Create an Instagram post announcing a 20% sale, using our brand colors'.

### SMB Practicality Assessment
- **Implementation Difficulty:** Low
- **Cost Factor:** Free
- **Time to Value:** Quick Wins (days/weeks)
- **Required Skills:**
  - Basic computer literacy
  - Ability to articulate a desired outcome
  - Willingness to experiment and refine prompts.

### Risks & Challenges for SMBs
- Assuming the AI 'knows' things without providing context, leading to generic outputs.
- Not evaluating the AI's output critically and publishing factually incorrect or off-brand information.
- Getting discouraged by initial poor results instead of using an iterative framework to improve them.
- For Vibe Coding, there's a huge risk of creating unmaintainable or insecure code if the user has no underlying technical knowledge.
