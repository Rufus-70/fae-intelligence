# Tool: Gemini

## Description
Gemini is Google's family of large language models. In the context of this video, its web interface, specifically the "Gems" feature (Google's version of custom GPTs), is used as a platform for a quick-start demonstration of the [[Tool: BMAD-METHOD]]. A pre-packaged "web bundle" file containing the entire agent framework is uploaded to Gemini to create a new Gem, enabling a user to interact with the AI agent team directly in the chat interface.

## Primary Capabilities
- **Custom Agent Creation (Gems):** Allows users to create specialized versions of the AI by providing custom instructions and knowledge files.
- **File-based Knowledge:** Can ingest knowledge from uploaded files (like the `.txt` web bundle from BMAD) to inform its responses and behavior.
- **Web UI:** Provides an accessible chat interface for interacting with the AI, lowering the technical barrier compared to API- or IDE-based solutions.

## Notes
The use of Gemini Gems here is a great example of making a complex system accessible. For Fae Intelligence, this technique can be used to package our own "Operational Wisdom" prompts into easily shareable custom GPTs for clients, giving them powerful tools without requiring any technical setup on their end.
