# Tool: Serena

## Description
Serena is a powerful, open-source coding agent toolkit that functions as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. Its primary purpose is to provide AI coding assistants like Claude Code with semantic understanding of a specific codebase. It works by first "indexing" a project, creating a symbol database. Then, instead of the AI reading entire files, Serena uses semantic search to find and provide only the most relevant code snippets for a given task. This makes the AI faster, more accurate, and dramatically reduces token consumption.

## Primary Capabilities
- **Codebase Indexing:** Pre-analyzes a project to build an intelligent, searchable index of its structure and components.
- **Semantic Search:** Understands the meaning of code to retrieve functions, classes, and variables relevant to a developer's query.
- **MCP Server Integration:** Acts as a plug-in for any MCP-compatible client, such as Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf.
- **Local and Web-based Operation:** Can be installed and run locally for a specific project directory.

## Notes
Serena is a technical but highly impactful tool for any SMB that does software development. It directly addresses the main bottleneck of using LLMs on custom code, making it a force multiplier for developer productivity and a direct cost-saving measure.
