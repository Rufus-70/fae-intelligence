# Solution: Real-time AI Usage Monitoring

## Description
This solution involves using a dedicated tool to provide a real-time, terminal-based dashboard that tracks key metrics related to the usage of an AI coding assistant. Instead of waiting for a monthly bill or hitting a hard limit unexpectedly, developers can see their consumption as it happens. The dashboard can display cost usage, token usage, message count against a limit, and time remaining until the limits reset.

## Primary Use Cases
- **Use Case 1 (Budget Management):** A development team lead can monitor the team's collective usage to ensure they stay within their monthly budget for AI tools.
- **Use Case 2 (Personal Efficiency):** A developer can see their "burn rate" of tokens/minute and adjust their prompting style or workflow to be more efficient and stretch their usage allowance further.

## Notes
This solution directly aligns with Fae's focus on practical, results-oriented solutions. It demystifies the cost of AI and puts control back in the hands of the SMB. It's a simple, high-impact tool that any business using pay-per-use AI should implement.
