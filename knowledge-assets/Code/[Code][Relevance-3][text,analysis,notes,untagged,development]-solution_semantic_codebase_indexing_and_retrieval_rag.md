# Solution: Semantic Codebase Indexing and Retrieval (RAG)

## Description
This solution, often called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), addresses inefficient AI performance by fundamentally changing how the AI gets information about a codebase. Instead of the AI performing a "textual search" by reading many files, the codebase is first pre-processed or "indexed" to create a searchable database of code symbols, functions, and relationships. When a developer makes a request, a tool performs a "semantic search" on this index to find only the most relevant snippets of code and feeds just those pieces into the AI's context window.

This keeps the context window lean, focused, and highly relevant, dramatically improving the AI's speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency. The video presents this as the key to unlocking the full potential of AI code assistants.

## Primary Use Cases
- **Use Case 1 (Large Codebase Interaction):** Allowing an AI like Claude Code to effectively reason about and modify code in a project with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, which would be impossible if it had to read every file.
- **Use Case 2 (Targeted Bug Fixing):** When a developer reports a bug, the system can semantically find the specific functions and related components and provide them to the AI, rather than having the AI guess where the bug might be.

## Notes
This is a powerful, enterprise-grade technique that is now accessible to SMBs via open-source tools. Fae Intelligence should position this as a strategic investment in developer productivity. The initial setup effort pays dividends in every subsequent interaction with the AI.
