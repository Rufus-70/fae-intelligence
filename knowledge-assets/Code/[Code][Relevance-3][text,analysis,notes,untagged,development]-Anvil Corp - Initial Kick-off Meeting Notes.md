## I. Current State & Pain Points

### 1. Current Data Landscape
*Questions to understand what they have and where it lives.*

-   **What types of process documentation do you currently have?**
    -   *Examples: Work instructions, quality manuals, checklists, flowcharts, training records.* 
    -   Notes: 
-   **Where is this data stored?**
    -   *Examples: Shared network drive, local spreadsheets, a specific ERP system, physical binders?*
    -   Notes: 
-   **How is this documentation currently managed and updated?**
    -   *Is there a formal change control process?*
    -   Notes: 

### 2. Existing Tools & Usage
*Questions to understand their daily workflow.*

-   **What are your primary collaboration tools?**
    -   *e.g., Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel, SharePoint), Google Workspace, something else?*
    -   Notes: 
-   **Are you using any form of dashboard or reporting for quality metrics?**
    -   Notes: 

### 3. Specific Pain Points for ISO 9001
*Focusing on the core problem.*

-   **What is the single biggest challenge you face with your documentation right now?**
    -   *e.g., "It's out of date," "No one knows where to find anything," "We have gaps we can't identify."*
    -   Notes: 
-   **Describe one decision you make regularly where better documentation would lead to a better outcome.**
    -   *e.g., Operator training, handling a non-conformance, onboarding a new supplier.*
    -   Notes:

## II. AI Tool Feasibility & Security Policy Assessment

*This is the critical section for this project. We need to understand their limitations clearly.*

-   **Could you describe your company's policies regarding the use of external software or cloud services?**
    -   *Is there a pre-approved list of tools?*
    -   Notes: 
-   **Is data allowed to leave your internal network? If so, are there specific conditions?**
    -   *e.g., "Only to our Microsoft 365 tenant," "No cloud services are permitted."*
    -   Notes: 
-   **Does your IT department need to approve any new tool or script before it can be used?**
    -   Notes: 
-   **Are there specific data sensitivity levels we need to be aware of?**
    -   *e.g., Proprietary manufacturing processes, sensitive client information.*
    -   Notes:
