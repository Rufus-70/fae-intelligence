# Customer Pain Point: Complex Tool Installation and Setup

## Description
This pain point describes the frustration and time-cost associated with installing, configuring, and integrating new or complex tools, particularly in a software development context. The speaker in the source video explicitly notes that a key piece of feedback for v3 of their tool was that "it was still a little bit hard to understand how to install and get everything going" (00:46). This friction can be a major barrier to adoption for otherwise powerful tools.

## Manifestations & Examples
- **Example 1:** A development team spends half a day trying to get a new framework running, dealing with dependency issues and environment configuration instead of writing code.
- **Example 2:** A solo founder (a typical Fae Intelligence client) wants to try a new AI tool but gives up after the installation instructions require multiple complex command-line steps.
- **Example 3:** Different team members end up with slightly different configurations of the same tool, leading to "works on my machine" problems.

## Notes
From an operational wisdom perspective, reducing setup friction is one of the highest leverage activities for improving productivity. For Fae Intelligence, recommending and implementing tools with simple, robust installation processes is a key value-add that saves clients time and frustration.
