**Project ID:** CURR-AUDIT-04  
**Status:** 🔄 **PLANNED** - Awaiting Content Development  
**Duration:** 2 Weeks (August 19 - September 1, 2025)  
**Owner:** User Experience Team  
**Prerequisites:** Bridge Module Creation, Learning Objective Audit

## 🎯 Project Goals

**Primary Objective:** Validate educational improvements through real user behavior analysis and identify remaining friction points

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] User journey analytics implemented and tracking
- [ ] Friction points identified at module and transition level
- [ ] A/B testing framework established for content optimization
- [ ] Data-driven recommendations for further improvements

## 📋 Current State Hypothesis

### **Expected Improvements from Bridge Modules:**
- **Reduced Dropout:** <20% at technical transitions (previously 60-80%)
