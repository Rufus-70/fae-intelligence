      "The 'TCRI' prompt framework is a perfect real-world business analogy. Richard Snyder would frame it as a 'Creative Brief'. For 30 years, giving any employee a new 'Task' without proper 'Context' and 'Resources' (examples of good work) leads to failure. The 'Evaluate/Iterate' loop is simply the day-to-day process of management and coaching. Teaching SMBs this framework is teaching them how to manage a very smart, very literal junior employee.",
      "The 'RSTI' debugging framework mirrors classic process improvement. When a process (the prompt) fails, the first step is to 'Revisit' the original plan (the TCRI brief). If it's too complex, 'Separate' it into smaller steps. Operational wisdom values clarity and simplicity in instructions.",
      "The concept of 'Vibe Coding' without understanding fundamentals like version control is operationally reckless. An experienced leader would stress that while AI can accelerate work, it doesn't remove the need for foundational business practices like backups and checkpoints. Losing two weeks of work because you didn't have a simple checkpoint system is an unforced error Fae Intelligence can help SMBs avoid."

  "generalVideoSummary": "This video serves as a comprehensive crash course on the essential AI concepts for 2025, guiding viewers from beginner to advanced topics. It begins by defining key terms like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Generative AI, then provides a deep dive into Prompt Engineering, offering two practical mnemonic frameworks ('Tiny Crabs Ride Enormous Iguanas' and 'Ramen Saves Tragic Idiots') to help users create effective and specific prompts. The video then explores the intermediate topic of AI Agents, explaining their core components, and the advanced concept of 'Vibe Coding,' where AI handles the implementation details of software development. Finally, it looks at the future of AI, emphasizing the trends of AI integration into existing products, the importance of learning AI-assisted coding, and the massive growth potential of AI Agents."
