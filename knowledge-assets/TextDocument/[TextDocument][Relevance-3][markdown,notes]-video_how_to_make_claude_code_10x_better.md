# Video: How to Make Claude Code 10x Better (Inferred)
## Description
This technical video explains that AI coding assistants like Anthropic's Claude Code are often used inefficiently due to "context window clutter." It introduces two open-source tools to solve this: **Serena**, an MCP server that uses semantic search (RAG) to provide the AI with only the most relevant codebase context, and the **Claude Code Usage Monitor**, a real-time terminal dashboard for tracking token and cost usage. The core argument is that by combining these tools, developers can make their AI assistant faster, more accurate, and more cost-effective.
## Key Concepts Covered
- **Context Window Clutter:** The problem of an AI processing thousands of lines of irrelevant code, which degrades performance and increases costs.
- **Textual vs. Semantic Search:** The video contrasts basic textual search with more advanced semantic search, which understands the meaning and relationships within code to retrieve only relevant information.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Code:** The underlying technique used by Serena to index a codebase and provide relevant context to the LLM on the fly.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** The standard used by tools like Claude Code and Cursor to communicate with external context providers like Serena.
- **Real-time Usage Monitoring:** The importance of tracking token consumption and costs to optimize AI usage and avoid unexpected bills.
