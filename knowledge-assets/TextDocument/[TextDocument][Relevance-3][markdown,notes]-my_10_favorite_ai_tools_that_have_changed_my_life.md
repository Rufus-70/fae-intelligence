## ADVOCATED PROCESSES

### Process 1: Content & Script Development Workflow

- **Process Description:** This process uses a powerful LLM (Claude) as a specialized assistant for various content creation tasks. By creating "Projects," the user pre-loads the AI with specific knowledge and instructions for recurring tasks like scriptwriting, article cleanup, and title generation, making it an expert on demand.
- **Target Audience:** Content creators, marketing teams, YouTubers, copywriters, and SMBs managing their own content.
- **Step-by-Step Guide:**
    - **Step 1: Create a Project in Claude:** Define a new project for a specific task (e.g., "Shorts Writer").
    - **Step 2: Upload Project Knowledge:** Provide the project with relevant context, such as transcripts of past successful videos, style guides, or formatting rules.
    - **Step 3: Set Custom Instructions:** Give the project a clear role and instructions on how to behave (e.g., "You are a short-form scriptwriter. Create video scripts that are one minute or less in the style of the provided knowledge.").
    - **Step 4: Provide Task-Specific Input:** In a new chat within the project, provide the raw input (e.g., a long-form video transcript, a list of messy URLs, a video concept).
    - **Step 5: Receive Formatted Output:** The AI generates the desired content (a 60-second script, a cleaned-up list of links, a list of potential titles) according to the project's pre-defined rules.
- **User Benefits and Savings:**
    - **Quantitative Savings:**
        - **Metric:** Script/Copy Drafting Time | **Value:** Reduced by 60-80% (Inferred) | **Context:** Dramatically accelerates the process of turning raw ideas or long-form content into structured, ready-to-use copy.

        - Employee Productivity

### Process 3: AI-Enhanced Media Production

- **Process Description:** A workflow for creating and enhancing media assets. It starts with generating base images in Leonardo.ai, using Stable Diffusion (via Automatic1111) for advanced modifications like face swapping, creating custom music beds with Suno, and using Topaz Labs' Photo AI to upscale and clean up the final images for professional quality.
- **Target Audience:** Marketing teams, social media managers, video editors, content creators.
- **Step-by-Step Guide:**
    - **Step 1: Generate Base Image:** Use Leonardo.ai's Phoenix model with stylistic presets (e.g., Moody, Cinematic) to create the initial visual concept.
    - **Step 2: Refine & Customize (Optional):** Import the image into a local Stable Diffusion instance (Automatic1111) to perform complex edits like face swapping using a fine-tuned LoRA model.
    - **Step 3: Generate Custom Music:** Use Suno to create a custom song by providing a genre and topic (e.g., "heavy metal song about waiting for a video to render").
    - **Step 4: Upscale & Finalize:** Take the final image and run it through Topaz Photo AI to remove noise, sharpen details, and upscale it for high-resolution use (e.g., in a video thumbnail).
- **User Benefits and Savings:**
    - **Quantitative Savings:**

- **Key Concepts and Definitions:**
    - **Concept:** AI Tool Stack
        - **Definition from Video:** A curated collection of specialized AI tools used in combination to achieve a complex workflow, rather than relying on a single, monolithic tool.
        - **Relevance to SMBs:** This is a crucial concept. SMBs should not look for one "magic bullet" AI. The real power comes from integrating a few best-in-class, affordable tools into a cohesive process. Fae helps clients build and manage their unique AI tool stack.
    - **Concept:** AI-Powered Curation
        - **Definition from Video:** Using an AI like Feedly's "Leo" to proactively find and filter information based on topics and user feedback, rather than just subscribing to predefined sources.
        - **Relevance to SMBs:** This is a game-changer for competitive intelligence and market research. An SMB can monitor topics like "new coffee shops in Portland" or "competitor X mentions" and get a curated digest automatically, saving hours of manual searching.
    - **Concept:** AI-Assisted Creativity
        - **Definition from Video:** Using AI tools like Suno and Leonardo not as a replacement for creativity, but as a partner to generate initial ideas, concepts, and assets that a human then refines and directs.
        - **Relevance to SMBs:** This lowers the barrier for high-quality marketing. An SMB owner who isn't a musician or graphic designer can now generate on-brand background music and social media images, giving them creative capabilities that were previously out of reach.

## FAE INTELLIGENCE STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

- **Operational Wisdom Integration Points:**
    - **The "Tool vs. System" Fallacy:** The video presents a powerful but disconnected list of tools. An SMB's challenge isn't just knowing the tools, but integrating them into a seamless business *system*. Fae's operational wisdom connects the dots: the transcript from Otter.ai should automatically feed into a Claude project that drafts follow-up emails, which are then scheduled in a CRM. We build the "plumbing" between the tools.
    - **Prioritizing for ROI:** The speaker uses these tools for his specific workflow as a content creator. Fae would help an SMB map these tools to *their* most critical business functions. For a local service business, Otter.ai for client meeting notes is a huge win. For an e-commerce store, Leonardo for product mockups is key. We help them focus on the 20% of tools that drive 80% of the value for their specific business model.
    - **The Human Touch is Non-Negotiable:** While AI generates content and media, the final output always benefits from a human review to ensure it aligns with the brand's voice and strategic goals. Fae emphasizes building "human-in-the-loop" workflows, where AI does the heavy lifting, but the business owner gives the final approval.

- **AI Application Angles:**
    - **"SMB Intelligence Dashboard" Service:** Offer a managed service using Feedly and Perplexity to create a custom dashboard for SMB clients that tracks their specific industry, competitors, and local market news. We deliver a weekly intelligence briefing based on the AI's findings.
    - **"AI Creative Asset" Package:** Bundle Leonardo.ai, Suno, and Topaz Labs into a fixed-price package for SMBs. For a monthly fee, we generate a set number of social media images, blog thumbnails, and background music tracks, giving them a professional marketing presence without hiring a full-time creative.
    - **"Second Brain for Business" Setup:** Implement MyMind for an SMB's leadership team. We would help them establish the process of saving key documents, competitor info, and client notes, creating a searchable, collective intelligence for the entire company.

- **SMB Practicality Assessment:**
    - **Overall Ease of Implementation:** **Medium.** While many tools are individually easy to use, creating a productive *system* from them requires dedication. Some tools like Stable Diffusion (running locally) have a high technical barrier. Others like Claude, Perplexity, and Feedly are very accessible.
    - **Estimated Cost Factor:** **Low-Cost to Significant Investment (Inferred).** Many tools have free or affordable starting tiers. However, a full stack with Pro plans for Claude, Perplexity, Otter, Leonardo, etc., can add up to a significant monthly subscription cost that needs to be justified by productivity gains.
    - **Required Skill Prerequisites:**
        - A strong sense of the business process to be improved.
        - Openness to experimenting with multiple platforms.
        - Good organizational skills to manage the outputs from different tools.
    - **Time to Value:** **Immediate to Quick Wins.** A user can get immediate value from a single tool like Perplexity or Suno. Building an integrated workflow that combines multiple tools will take more time but offers greater, more systemic rewards.

- **Potential Risks and Challenges for SMBs:**
    - **Tool Overload and Subscription Fatigue:** An SMB could sign up for 10+ tools, leading to confusion, underutilization, and high monthly costs. The challenge is to consolidate and focus on a few key tools.
    - **Data Security:** Using multiple third-party cloud tools increases the surface area for data privacy risks. An SMB must be diligent about what company information is uploaded to which service, especially those without clear enterprise-grade privacy policies.
    - **Lack of Integration:** Without a central automation platform (like n8n or Zapier), this stack remains a collection of manual processes. The user is still the "plumber," copying and pasting data between tools, which limits the ultimate productivity gain.

- **Alignment with Fae Mission:** **Excellent.** This video provides a fantastic overview of the current, practical AI landscape. It aligns perfectly with Fae's mission by showcasing accessible tools that can solve real business problems. It serves as a perfect conversation starter for Fae to engage with an SMB. We can say, "These tools are amazing, right? Now let's talk about which ones will actually save you the most time and how we can build them into a reliable, automated system for your business."

- **General Video Summary:**
The video is a personal and practical review of the AI tools that the speaker, Matt Wolfe, uses daily to enhance his productivity and creative workflow. He starts with his core "thinking and writing" tool, **Claude**, highlighting its "Projects" feature for creating specialized assistants. For web search and quick answers, he relies on **Perplexity**. His information-gathering process is powered by **Feedly**, which uses an AI named Leo to curate news on specific topics, and **MyMind**, which acts as a "second brain" to save and automatically tag any interesting content from across the web. For creative work, his primary image generator is **Leonardo.ai**, praised for its Phoenix model and stylistic presets. He still uses a local instance of **Stable Diffusion** for complex tasks like face-swapping. To create custom music for his videos, he uses **Suno**. For professional upscaling of images, he uses **Topaz Labs Photo AI** and sometimes **Krea.ai**. For transcribing meetings and presentations, he uses **Otter.ai** to generate summaries and outlines. Finally, for his YouTube channel, he uses **Spotter Labs** for trend-spotting and generating ideas for thumbnails and titles. The video serves as a powerful demonstration of how a stack of specialized AI tools can be integrated into a daily workflow to save time, enhance creativity, and stay informed.
