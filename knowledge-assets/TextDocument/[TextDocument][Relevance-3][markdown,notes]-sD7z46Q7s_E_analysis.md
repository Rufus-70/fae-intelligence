## Business Processes & Implementation Guides
### Process 1: No-Code Automated Customer Support Agent
**Description:** An automated workflow that receives customer emails, classifies their intent using AI, and routes them to different sub-agents for handling. This demonstrates the 'Routing' agentic workflow pattern using a no-code tool.

**Target Audience:**
- Small to Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs)
- Startups with limited support staff
- E-commerce businesses
- Solopreneurs

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Set Up a Trigger for New Inquiries**
   - Details: The process starts when a new email arrives in a designated inbox. This is the entry point for all customer support requests.
   - Tools: n8n (Gmail Trigger node)
   - Time/Effort: 10 minutes setup

2. **Classify the Email's Intent with AI**
   - Details: The content of the email is passed to a text classifier sub-agent, powered by an OpenAI model. This agent's sole purpose is to categorize the email as 'Technical Support', 'Billing', or 'General Inquiry'.
   - Tools: n8n (Text Classifier node), OpenAI Chat Model
   - Time/Effort: Automated

3. **Route the Inquiry to a Specialized Sub-Agent**
   - Details: Based on the classification, the workflow branches. Each branch leads to a different sub-agent that is specialized for a single task.
   - Tools: n8n (If/Switch node)
   - Time/Effort: Automated

4. **Execute the Specialized Task (e.g., Billing)**
   - Details: If classified as 'Billing' (e.g., a refund request), the dedicated billing sub-agent drafts and sends a standardized email reply asking the customer for more specific information (like transaction date).
   - Tools: n8n (AI Agent node, Gmail node)
   - Time/Effort: Automated

5. **Handle Complex Cases and Human Escalation**
   - Details: If the inquiry is 'Technical Support', the sub-agent first attempts to answer using a knowledge base. If it cannot, it automatically escalates the issue by posting a message to a human team on a platform like Discord, including the original email ID for context.
   - Tools: n8n (HTTP Request node for docs, IF node, Discord node)
   - Time/Effort: Automated

**Quantitative Benefits:**
- Time Saved: 5-10 hours/week - Automates the initial triage and response for common customer inquiries, freeing up human staff to focus on complex issues.
- Cost Reduction: Potential reduction of 1 part-time support role - Handles the majority of Tier 1 support requests, reducing the required headcount for customer service.
**Qualitative Benefits:**
- Faster response times for customers.
- Consistent handling of inquiries.
- Ensures complex issues are escalated to the right people.
- Scales customer support capacity without adding staff.

### Process 2: Systematic Prompt Engineering for AI Agents
**Description:** A foundational, six-component framework for providing clear, comprehensive instructions to an AI agent to ensure high-quality, relevant, and predictable outputs, reducing the need for multiple revisions.

**Target Audience:**
- All business professionals
- Marketers
- Managers
- Anyone who interacts with AI

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Define the ROLE**
   - Details: Tell the AI who it should be. Specify a persona and the desired tone. Example: 'You are an AI research assistant. Your style is succinct, direct, and focused on essential information.'
   - Time/Effort: Part of prompt writing

2. **Define the TASK**
   - Details: Clearly state the end goal or what the AI should accomplish. Example: 'Given a search term related to AI news, perform a web search... and produce a concise summary of the key points.'
   - Time/Effort: Part of prompt writing

3. **Define the INPUT**
   - Details: Describe what kind of information the AI will receive to perform the task. Example: 'The input is a specific AI-related search term provided by the user.'
   - Time/Effort: Part of prompt writing

4. **Define the OUTPUT**
   - Details: Be highly specific about the final deliverable. Specify the format, length, and content. Example: 'Provide only a succinct... summary capturing the essence... approximately 2-3 short paragraphs, totaling no more than 300 words.'
   - Time/Effort: Part of prompt writing

5. **Define the CONSTRAINTS**
   - Details: Clearly state what the AI should *not* do. This is critical for preventing unwanted behavior. Example: 'Ignore fluff, background information, and commentary. Do not include your own analysis or opinions.'
   - Time/Effort: Part of prompt writing

6. **Define CAPABILITIES & REMINDERS**
   - Details: Remind the AI of the tools it has and the important context it needs to remember. Example: 'You have access to the web search tool... You must be deeply aware of the current date... summarizing only information published within the past 7 days.'
   - Time/Effort: Part of prompt writing

**Quantitative Benefits:**
**Qualitative Benefits:**
- Dramatically improves quality of AI outputs
- Reduces wasted time on revisions
- Provides a reliable method for consistent results
- Builds a fundamental skill for leveraging AI effectively

## Fae Intelligence Strategic Analysis
### Operational Wisdom Integration
- The 'burger' analogy for AI agent components is brilliant for SMBs. Richard Snyder would extend this by explaining that just like in a kitchen, if you use a cheap bun (low-quality model) or stale lettuce (bad data), the whole burger (the agent's output) will be subpar, regardless of how good the patty is. Quality in, quality out.
- The customer support routing workflow is excellent, but an operational leader would immediately ask, 'What happens when the Discord escalation fails or isn't seen?' Fae Intelligence would recommend adding a redundant, time-based check. If a ticket isn't acknowledged in Discord within 30 minutes, a secondary alert should be sent via email to a manager to prevent critical issues from falling through the cracks.
- The advice to 'start with your own problem' is a cornerstone of operational excellence. Fae can reframe this for SMB leaders: 'What's the most repetitive, low-value task you or your team does in a SaaS tool every day? Let's automate that first.' This focuses on immediate ROI and time savings, building momentum for more complex projects.

### AI Application Opportunities
- The customer support routing agent is the most direct and practical AI application for any SMB with a contact email. It can be built with no-code tools and provides immediate value by triaging inbound requests.
- The AI news aggregator demonstrates how SMBs can build custom intelligence feeds. A marketing manager could adapt this to track competitor mentions on Reddit and Twitter, sending a daily summary to their phone.
- The 'Monkeys Throw Kites' mnemonic provides a framework to empower any SMB employee to become an 'AI wrangler.' They don't need to code, but they can learn to provide structured instructions to get the AI to perform valuable tasks, which is a massive force multiplier.

### Alignment with Fae Intelligence Mission
This video is exceptionally aligned with Fae's mission. It masterfully demystifies the complex topic of AI agents by breaking it down into fundamental components and workflow patterns, using clear analogies (the burger) and mnemonics ('Monkeys Throw Kites'). It provides practical, step-by-step examples for both non-technical (no-code) and technical users, which directly serves Fae's goal of empowering all SMBs. The emphasis on starting with real problems and using the simplest effective solution is a core tenet of Fae's experience-backed approach.

## Video Summary
This video is a comprehensive guide to building AI agents for both beginners and experts. It starts by defining the fundamental components of any AI agent (Models, Tools, Knowledge/Memory, Audio/Speech, Guardrails, Orchestration) using an easy-to-understand 'burger' analogy. It then explains the five common agentic workflow patterns (Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, Evaluator-Optimizer, and Autonomous agents). The video provides practical, real-world examples of these patterns, including building a no-code customer support agent and a news aggregator in n8n, as well as a more complex coded financial research assistant using Python. Finally, it offers a framework for finding valuable AI agent ideas by focusing on solving real-world problems and keeping solutions as simple as possible.
