```

### **Phase 2: Project-Specific Extraction**
```bash
# BlogWriter: Extract all multi-agent system conversations
# KATA: Extract methodology implementation discussions
# Technical: Extract Jetson and edge AI development work
# MCP: Extract advanced server configuration discussions
```

### **Phase 3: Content Synthesis**
```bash
# Create complete implementation guides for each project
# Build comprehensive technical documentation
# Generate business intelligence summaries
# Develop integration recommendations for Fae Intelligence
```

### **Phase 4: Deduplication & Integration**
```bash
# Identify best implementations vs. superseded versions
# Consolidate scattered knowledge into coherent guides
# Create ready-to-deploy configurations and procedures
# Update Fae Intelligence platform with enhanced capabilities
```
