# Multi-LLM RAG System Implementation Project Status

**Source:** `/home/rosie/projects/rag-system-v2/docs/multi-llm-integration/project-implementation-status.md`

**Project Goal:** Enable multiple LLM systems to interact with RAG system through expanded MCP server capabilities

**Current Status:** RAG system operational, MCP server running, command restrictions blocking LLM access

**Target Outcome:** Any LLM connecting via MCP can query RAG system, read files, and perform analysis

## PROJECT PHASES

### PHASE 1: DISCOVERY & CONFIGURATION MAPPING
**Objective:** Locate and understand current MCP command restrictions

#### Major Discovery:
**MCP Server Configuration:** Uses BLOCKLIST approach
```json
{
  "blockedCommands": [
    "format", "mount", "umount", "mkfs", "fdisk", "dd", 
    "sudo", "su", "passwd", "adduser", "useradd", "usermod", "groupadd"
  ]
}
```

#### Critical Finding:
- ‚úÖ MCP server itself allows curl, python3, cat, grep, etc.
- ‚ùå Docker Desktop interface is restricting commands to basic set
- üîç Root Issue: Interface layer filtering, NOT MCP server configuration

### PHASE 2: INTERFACE RESTRICTION ANALYSIS
**Objective:** Understand why Docker Desktop interface restricts commands despite MCP server allowing them

#### INVESTIGATION RESULTS:
- MCP JSON-RPC Test: ‚úÖ MCP server responds to tool calls but execution environment limited
- Key Findings:
    - ‚úÖ MCP server accepts and processes JSON-RPC tool calls
    - ‚ùå MCP container environment lacks bash (Alpine Linux base)
    - ‚ùå Docker Desktop interface still restricts exec commands
    - ‚úÖ MCP logs show normal IPC communication

#### DECISION: IMPLEMENT OPTION C - PROXY SOLUTION
Rationale:
- Docker Desktop interface restrictions appear hardcoded
- MCP container has limited execution environment
- Proxy container provides controlled, documented approach
- Maintains security while enabling multi-LLM access

### PHASE 3: PROXY CONTAINER IMPLEMENTATION
**Objective:** Create unrestricted proxy container for multi-LLM RAG system access

#### Implementation Tasks:
- Create proxy container with required tools
- Test network connectivity to RAG system
- Test file system access to projects
- Verify Docker socket access for container management
- Test HTTP API calls to RAG endpoints
- Create access verification script

### PHASE 4: VERIFICATION & TESTING
**Objective:** Confirm multi-LLM RAG access is working comprehensively and test advanced capabilities

#### LLM Capability Tests:
- Claude (current instance) can access RAG
- Test expanded command capabilities via proxy
- Advanced file system operations across all project types
- RAG API queries functional with complex requests
- System monitoring capabilities active

#### Integration Tests:
- RAG + n8n workflow integration via proxy
- RAG + MCP file sharing coordination
- Multi-system health monitoring dashboard
- Performance impact assessment
- Cross-container communication testing

### PHASE 5: DOCUMENTATION & OPTIMIZATION
**Objective:** Finalize documentation, optimize performance, and establish long-term maintenance procedures

#### Documentation Tasks:
- Update RAG System SOP with proxy access procedures
- Create comprehensive Multi-LLM Integration Guide
- Document all discovered API endpoints and usage patterns
- Create troubleshooting guide for complex scenarios
- Document security boundaries and best practices

#### Optimization Tasks:
- Performance tuning based on Phase 4 results
- Container resource optimization
- Network latency improvements
- Storage optimization for large file operations
- Automated monitoring script deployment

#### Maintenance Setup:
- Create automated health check scripts
- Set up log rotation and cleanup procedures
- Create backup and recovery procedures
- Document container update procedures
- Create performance monitoring dashboard
