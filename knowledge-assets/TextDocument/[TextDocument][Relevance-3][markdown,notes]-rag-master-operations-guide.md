Quick Reference - Essential Operations
🚀 System Health Check
bash# Complete system health verification
docker exec claude-llm-proxy /tmp/master_health_check.sh

# Expected: 8/8 checks PASSED
# ✅ Container status, API health, file systems, multi-LLM access
📊 Performance Dashboard
bash# Real-time performance monitoring
docker exec claude-llm-proxy /tmp/master_performance_dashboard.sh

# Shows: System metrics, container performance, API status, LLM access
💾 System Backup
bash# Create comprehensive backup
docker exec claude-llm-proxy /tmp/master_backup_system.sh

# Creates: Configuration, data, and system state backups
🔧 Emergency Recovery
bash# Automatic system recovery
docker exec claude-llm-proxy /tmp/emergency_recovery.sh

# Handles: Container restart, file index rebuild, library restoration

Daily Operations Checklist
🌅 Morning Operations (8:00 AM)
bash# 1. System health verification
docker exec claude-llm-proxy /tmp/master_health_check.sh

# 2. Performance dashboard review
docker exec claude-llm-proxy /tmp/master_performance_dashboard.sh

# 3. Check overnight logs
docker exec claude-llm-proxy tail -20 /tmp/scheduled_health.log

# 4. Verify multi-LLM access
docker exec claude-llm-proxy curl http://backend:8000/health
docker exec claude-llm-proxy ls /projects/rag-system-v2/ | wc -l
🔄 Ongoing Monitoring (Automated)

Every 5 minutes: Automated health checks
Every 30 seconds: Performance dashboard refresh
Every 2 hours: Log rotation evaluation
Daily 2 AM: Automated cleanup and backup

🌙 Evening Verification (6:00 PM)
bash# 1. Daily performance summary
docker exec claude-llm-proxy cat /tmp/dashboard_snapshot.txt | head -20

# 2. Backup status verification
docker exec claude-llm-proxy ls -la /tmp/backups/ | tail -5

# 3. System resource status
docker exec claude-llm-proxy df -h /tmp /projects
docker exec claude-llm-proxy free -h

Emergency Response Procedures
🚨 Critical System Failures

Backend API Down
bash# Immediate response
docker exec claude-llm-proxy /tmp/emergency_recovery.sh

# If unsuccessful
docker-compose restart backend

# Verify recovery
docker exec claude-llm-proxy /tmp/master_health_check.sh

Multi-LLM Access Lost
bash# Check proxy container status
docker ps | grep claude-llm-proxy

# Restart proxy if needed
docker restart claude-llm-proxy

# Full proxy redeployment if necessary
# [Follow proxy container update procedure]
