## ADVOCATED PROCESSES

### Process 1: Agentic Search for Comprehensive Market Research
- **Process Description:** A paradigm shift from traditional keyword search to "Agentic Search." Instead of a user clicking through dozens of links to synthesize information, the user provides a complex question, and the Comet browser acts as an agent to perform the entire research workflow: reading sources, analyzing content, identifying patterns, and generating a single, comprehensive, and sourced report.
- **Target Audience:** Business Owners, Marketers, Researchers, Consultants, Students, any knowledge worker.
- **Step-by-Step Guide:**
  - Step 1: **Formulate a strategic question.** (e.g., "What are the best marketing strategies for local businesses?").
  - Step 2: **Input the query into Comet.** The AI begins its "agentic" process.
  - Step 3: **AI Decomposes and Searches.** Comet breaks the main query into multiple sub-queries (e.g., "local business marketing tactics," "cost effective local business marketing") and searches the web.
  - Step 4: **AI Reads and Analyzes.** The agent reads dozens of websites, articles, and studies.
  - Step 5: **AI Synthesizes and Reports.** The agent pulls out the most important information, synthesizes it into a structured report with categories and bullet points, and provides citations for all sources used.
- **User Benefits and Savings:**
  - **Quantitative Savings:**
    - Metric: Time Spent on Research | Value: Hours/Days reduced to minutes (Inferred) | Context: Automates the entire manual process of finding, reading, filtering, and synthesizing information from multiple web pages.

    - Higher quality, more comprehensive answers.
    - Drastically reduced cognitive load and frustration.

- **Key Concepts and Definitions:**
  - **Concept:** Agentic Search
    - **Definition from Video:** A fancy way of saying the AI acts like your personal research assistant. It doesn't just find information; it understands what you need, makes decisions about what's important, and synthesizes a complete answer with sources.
    - **Relevance to SMBs:** This directly translates into massive time and cost savings. An SMB owner can now perform sophisticated market research or competitive analysis—tasks that would previously require an expensive consultant or days of their own time—in just a few minutes.
  - **Concept:** AI-Native Browser
    - **Definition from Video:** A browser built from the ground up to be AI-powered, where every part is designed to work with AI, rather than an existing browser with AI features "stuck in."
    - **Relevance to SMBs:** This means a more focused, productive, and less distracting experience. For an SMB where every minute counts, having a tool designed specifically for efficient knowledge work, rather than general consumption, is a significant practical advantage.
  - **Concept:** Contextual Awareness
    - **Definition from Video:** The browser remembers everything you've looked at, connecting dots between research sessions. If you research one topic, it uses that context to provide better answers for a related query later.
    - **Relevance to SMBs:** This solves the problem of "lost work" and fragmented research. An SMB owner researching a business plan over several weeks can rely on the tool to maintain context, ensuring that insights build on each other, leading to a more coherent final strategy.

## FAE INTELLIGENCE STRATEGIC INSIGHTS
- **Operational Wisdom Integration Points:**
  - **Focus on ROI:** The video highlights a $200/month price tag. Fae's operational wisdom would immediately frame this for an SMB owner: "How many hours of your time, or your team's time, is spent on research? If this tool saves you 5 hours a month, it pays for itself. If it saves you 20, it's a massive profit center." We translate features into direct financial impact.
  - **Augmentation, Not Just Automation:** This tool is a prime example of AI *augmenting* a skilled human, not replacing them. It handles the low-value, tedious part of research (gathering and sifting), freeing the human to do the high-value part (critical thinking, strategy, applying the insights). This is a core Fae message.
  - **De-risking Decisions:** Having access to high-quality, synthesized research instantly de-risks business decisions. An SMB can quickly validate an idea, analyze a new market, or check a competitor's strategy before committing significant resources. This aligns with Fae's focus on risk mitigation.
- **AI Application Angles:**
  - **Market Intelligence as a Service:** Fae Intelligence can use Comet to offer a low-cost, rapid "Market Snapshot" service for SMBs. A client asks a strategic question, and we deliver a comprehensive, AI-generated report within 24 hours.
  - **AI Tool Stack Consultation:** Comet is one piece of a new productivity puzzle. Fae can offer consultations on building an "AI-Native Workflow" for SMBs, integrating tools like Comet with AI document creators, and automation platforms to streamline their entire operation.
  - **Prompting for Business Research Workshop:** Teach SMB owners *how* to ask the right strategic questions to get the most value from agentic search tools. The tool is only as good as the query; Fae can provide the strategic framework for effective questioning.
- **SMB Practicality Assessment:**
  - **Overall Ease of Implementation:** Easy. The user interface is a familiar browser/search bar. The learning curve is not in using the tool, but in learning to ask better, more strategic questions.
  - **Estimated Cost Factor:** Significant Investment (for premium tier). (Inferred) The $200/month "Max" plan is a serious consideration for an SMB. However, the value proposition is replacing labor hours that cost far more, making the ROI potentially very high. A lower-priced or free version is expected, which will be much more accessible.
  - **Required Skill Prerequisites:** Critical thinking, the ability to formulate strategic questions, and the discipline to verify important facts from the provided sources.
  - **Time to Value:** Immediate. Even the first simple query saves time compared to traditional search. The value increases exponentially as the user tackles more complex research tasks.
- **Potential Risks and Challenges for SMBs:**
  - **The "Good Enough" Trap:** An SMB might take the AI-generated report as absolute truth without exercising critical judgment or verifying key sources, leading to decisions based on flawed or incomplete information.
  - **Cost Justification:** An SMB owner might see the price tag and balk, without doing the cost-benefit analysis of their own time. Fae's role is to help them quantify that ROI.
  - **Skill Gap:** While easy to use, getting truly transformative results requires moving from simple search queries ("pizza near me") to complex strategic prompts. SMBs may need training to make this leap.
- **Alignment with Fae Mission:** This tool is perfectly aligned with the Fae mission. It's a cutting-edge AI application that delivers practical, tangible results (time savings, better insights). Fae's role is to be the experienced guide that helps SMBs in the Pacific Northwest cut through the hype, understand the real-world business case for a tool like Comet, and integrate it into their strategic planning and marketing workflows. We empower them by showing them how to leverage this new class of tool to compete more effectively and make smarter, data-driven decisions.
- **General Video Summary:** The video introduces Perplexity's new AI-native browser, Comet, positioning it as a revolutionary shift from traditional search. The core innovation is "Agentic Search," where the AI acts as a research assistant, taking a user's question, analyzing dozens of web sources, and delivering a complete, synthesized report in minutes, thereby saving hours of manual work. The browser is built from the ground up for AI, offering features like contextual awareness that remembers past research, a helpful assistant for browser management, and robust privacy controls. The speaker argues this tool democratizes high-level research, giving individuals and SMBs capabilities previously available only to large corporations, and will fundamentally change competitive intelligence, content creation, and business strategy.
