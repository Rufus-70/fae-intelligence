# Blog Workflow - Manual Review Implementation

**Source:** `/home/rosie/projects/workflows/MANUAL_REVIEW_SOLUTION.md`

## Intent: Review Keywords Before Continuing

You want to:
1. See the high search volume keywords
2. Manually review/approve them
3. Then continue with topic selection

## Solution: Save Keywords to Sheet + Short Wait

### Current Flow Issue:
```
High search volume keywords → Wait (can't see keywords) → Topic Selection
```

### Fixed Flow:
```
High search volume keywords 
    ↓
Save Keywords to Sheet (NEW - for review)
    ↓  
Short Wait (2-3 minutes - for manual review)
    ↓
Topic Selection continues
```

## New Node Configuration

**Node: "Save Keywords for Review"**
- Type: Google Sheets
- Sheet: Your existing "Fae_Intelligence_Blog_Hub" 
- Action: Append keywords to a "Review" column
- Data: The filtered keywords from previous step

**Node: "Review Pause"** 
- Type: Wait
- Amount: 3 minutes (not 10!)
- Mode: Time-based
- You review keywords in the sheet during this time

## Alternative: Manual Execution Mode

**Even Better Solution:**
1. Split at "High search volume keywords"
2. One path → Save keywords to sheet → STOP
3. You review in sheet
4. Manually trigger the second part when ready

This way you have full control and can see everything clearly in your Google Sheet.
