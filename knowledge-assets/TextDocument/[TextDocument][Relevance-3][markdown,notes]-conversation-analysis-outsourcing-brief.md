   - Project association (BlogWriter/KATA/Jetson/etc.)
5. Create structured CSV index of all discovered content
6. Identify duplicate or superseded conversations across chunks
```

**Output Format:**
```csv
chunk_id,conversation_id,title,date,category,business_value,keywords,summary,project_association

   - Jetson Orin Nano optimization procedures
   - MCP server configurations
3. Build troubleshooting procedures and verification scripts
4. Generate configuration files and setup procedures
5. Create professional technical documentation (markdown format)
```

**Output Format:**
```
