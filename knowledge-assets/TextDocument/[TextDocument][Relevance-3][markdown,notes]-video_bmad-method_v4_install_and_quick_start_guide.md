# Video: BMAD-METHOD v4 Install and Quick Start Guide

## Description
This video is a technical tutorial detailing the installation and initial usage of BMAD-METHOD v4, an open-source, AI-powered agile development framework. The speaker provides a step-by-step guide for two primary methods of getting started: a rapid "web bundle" approach for use in platforms like Gemini or ChatGPT, and a full CLI installer for deep integration with developer IDEs like Cursor, Claude Code, and others.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Simplified Installation:** Introduction of the new `npx bmad-method install` command, which simplifies setup and also handles upgrades from previous versions.
- **Web Bundles:** A quick-start method involving downloading a single `.txt` file from the project's GitHub `dist` folder and uploading it to create a custom Gem in Google Gemini, allowing immediate interaction with the AI agent team without a local install.
- **IDE Integration:** The primary installation method that sets up the BMad-Core framework, agents, commands, and rules directly within the project directory for use in IDEs like Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and Roo Code.
- **AI Agent Teams:** The core concept of using a team of specialized AI agents (e.g., Business Analyst, Product Manager, Architect, Developer) orchestrated by a central "BMAD Orchestrator" to manage the software development lifecycle.
- **Document Sharding & Migration:** The video demonstrates tasks for migrating older document formats to V4 and for "sharding" large documents into smaller, more manageable pieces for the AI agents.
