# Resource Page Modifications - Training Path Updates

## 📝 ATTEMPTED FIXES
**Date**: 2025-06-30
**Status**: ATTEMPTED (In Progress)
**Request**: Remove time estimates from training activities and reorganize training paths

### Modification Requirements
1. **Remove Time Estimates**: 
   - Remove time estimates from AI Newcomer, Tech Explorer, and Implementation Leader activities
   - Keep difficulty levels and ROI indicators
   - Remove clock icons and time display elements

2. **Training Path Organization**:
   - **Newcomer** (Fundamentals): AI Fundamentals for Business, Prompt Engineering for Leaders, AI Tools for Daily Productivity
   - **Tech Explorer** (Intermediate): Engineering Alignment, Top 20 AI Tools, Claude/ChatGPT Projects  
   - **Implementation Leader** (Advanced): Existing advanced modules

3. **Training Path Navigation**:
   - Clicking training path should show relevant sections of complete training modules
   - Create internal pages for external training links
   - Enable interactive pages for module collections

### Files to Modify
- `/src/app/resources/page.tsx` - Main resource page
- Create internal training module pages for external links
- Update training path destination pages
