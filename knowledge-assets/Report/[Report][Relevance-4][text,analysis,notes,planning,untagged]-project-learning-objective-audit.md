# Learning Objective Audit Project
**Date Created:** July 1, 2025  
**Project ID:** CURR-AUDIT-01  
**Status:** üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** - Week 1 of 2 (47% complete)  
**Duration:** 2 Weeks (July 1-14, 2025)  
**Owner:** Educational Design Team  
**Current Phase:** Module Analysis and SMART Objective Rewriting

## üéØ Project Goals

**Primary Objective:** Transform vague learning goals into specific, measurable, achievable learning objectives following Bloom's Taxonomy

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] 100% of modules have SMART learning objectives
- [ ] All objectives classified by Bloom's cognitive level
- [ ] Prerequisite knowledge explicitly documented for each module
- [ ] Assessment criteria defined for each learning objective

## üìã Current State Analysis

### **Problems Identified:**
1. **Vague Objectives:** "Learn AI Fundamentals" vs. measurable outcomes
2. **No Cognitive Level Classification:** Don't know what thinking level we're targeting
3. **Hidden Prerequisites:** Modules assume knowledge not explicitly taught
4. **No Assessment Criteria:** Can't verify if learning occurred

### **Example Current Issues:**
| Module | Current Objective | Issues | Bloom's Level |
|--------|------------------|--------|---------------|
| AI Fundamentals | "Learn AI basics" | Too vague, not measurable | Undefined |
| Prompt Engineering | "Master prompting" | No success criteria | Undefined |
| MCP Docker | "Master MCP & Docker" | Massive knowledge gap | Undefined |

## üîç Audit Framework

### **Analysis Method:**
```
FOR EACH MODULE:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Current Learning Objective Analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bloom's Taxonomy Classification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Prerequisite Knowledge Mapping  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Assessment Method Definition
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SMART Criteria Evaluation
```

### **Bloom's Taxonomy Levels:**
- **Remember:** Recall facts and concepts
- **Understand:** Explain ideas and principles
- **Apply:** Use knowledge in new situations
- **Analyze:** Break down complex problems
- **Evaluate:** Make informed judgments
- **Create:** Produce original work

### **SMART Criteria Check:**
- **Specific:** Clear, well-defined action
- **Measurable:** Can be assessed objectively
- **Achievable:** Realistic given prerequisites
- **Relevant:** Supports business/technical goals
- **Time-bound:** Clear completion timeline

## üìä Module Analysis Template

### **Module Assessment Form:**
```
MODULE: [Module Name]
CURRENT OBJECTIVE: [What's currently written]
ISSUES IDENTIFIED: [Problems with current objective]

PROPOSED SMART OBJECTIVE:
"By completing this module, you will be able to:"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Specific action verb] + [what] + [how well] (Bloom's Level: X)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Specific action verb] + [what] + [how well] (Bloom's Level: X)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Specific action verb] + [what] + [how well] (Bloom's Level: X)

PREREQUISITES:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Explicit: [What we say they need]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Implicit: [What we assume they know]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Missing: [What they need but we don't teach]

ASSESSMENT METHOD:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Knowledge Check: [How to test knowledge]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application: [How to test skills]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Validation: [How to confirm competency]
```

## üìÖ Execution Timeline

### **Week 1 (July 1-7, 2025):**
- [ ] **Day 1-2:** Audit all beginner level modules (AI Fundamentals, Prompt Engineering, Daily Productivity)
- [ ] **Day 3-4:** Audit all intermediate level modules (Engineering Alignment, AI Tools Budget, Claude ChatGPT Projects)
- [ ] **Day 5:** Audit advanced level modules (Notebook LM, AI Research Platforms, AI Project Hubs)

### **Week 2 (July 8-14, 2025):**
- [ ] **Day 1-2:** Audit programming training modules (ChatGPT Guide, MCP Docker Guide)
- [ ] **Day 3:** Audit Quick Wins modules
- [ ] **Day 4:** Compile findings and identify critical gaps
- [ ] **Day 5:** Create rewritten learning objectives for all modules

## üìà Success Metrics

### **Quantitative Targets:**
- **100% Module Coverage:** Every module analyzed and documented
- **SMART Compliance:** All objectives meet SMART criteria (scored 8/10+)
- **Bloom's Classification:** Every objective mapped to cognitive level
- **Assessment Alignment:** Every objective has corresponding assessment method

### **Quality Indicators:**
- **Specificity:** Action verbs clearly define what learner will do
- **Measurability:** Success criteria objectively verifiable  
- **Progression:** Logical skill building from module to module
- **Relevance:** Objectives directly support business/technical goals

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### **Potential Issues:**
- **Scope Creep:** Avoid redesigning content, focus only on objectives
- **Perfectionism:** Don't over-engineer, aim for "good enough to improve"
- **Technical Debt:** Some modules may need complete restructuring (flag for later)

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Time Boxing:** Strict 2-week timeline
- **Focus:** Objective analysis only, not content creation
- **Documentation:** Capture all findings for next project phases

## üìã Deliverables

### **Week 1 Deliverables:**
- [ ] **Module Audit Spreadsheet:** All current objectives analyzed
- [ ] **Bloom's Taxonomy Mapping:** Cognitive level classification
- [ ] **Prerequisite Gap Analysis:** What knowledge is missing
- [ ] **Critical Issues Report:** Top problems requiring immediate attention

### **Week 2 Deliverables:**
- [ ] **Rewritten Learning Objectives:** SMART objectives for all modules
- [ ] **Assessment Framework:** How to validate each objective
- [ ] **Implementation Priority:** Which modules need urgent fixes
- [ ] **Next Phase Briefing:** Handoff to Skill Gap Analysis project

## üîÑ Progress Tracking

### **Daily Standup Questions:**
1. Which modules were analyzed yesterday?
2. What critical gaps were discovered?
3. Any modules requiring complete restructuring?
4. On track for week timeline?

### **Weekly Review:**
- Modules completed vs. planned
- Quality of objective rewrites
- Assessment framework development
- Preparation for next project phase

## ‚úÖ Completion Criteria

### **Phase Complete When:**
- [ ] All modules have documented learning objective analysis
- [ ] SMART learning objectives written for every module
- [ ] Bloom's taxonomy classification completed
- [ ] Prerequisite knowledge gaps identified and documented
- [ ] Assessment criteria defined for each objective
- [ ] Critical restructuring needs flagged for future phases
- [ ] Handoff documentation prepared for Skill Gap Analysis project
