## 📋 **STEP 1: CURRENT OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS**

### **For Each Module:**

#### **1A. Current State Documentation**
```
DOCUMENTATION TEMPLATE:
======================
MODULE: [Module Name]
URL: [Module URL if known]
CURRENT OBJECTIVE: "[Exact text from module]"

ANALYSIS:
├── Specificity: [Rate 1-5, what makes it vague/specific?]
├── Measurability: [Rate 1-5, how would you test success?]
├── Action Verbs: [List action verbs used, classify cognitive level]
├── Success Criteria: [Are there any? What's missing?]
└── Time Boundary: [Is completion time specified?]
```

#### **1B. Problem Identification Checklist**
**Rate each criterion 1-5 (1=Poor, 5=Excellent):**

- [ ] **Specificity:** Does the objective clearly state what the learner will do?
  - 1: Vague (e.g., "learn about", "understand")
  - 3: Somewhat specific (mentions topics but not actions)
  - 5: Very specific (clear action + context + criteria)

- [ ] **Measurability:** Can success be objectively verified?
  - 1: No way to measure (e.g., "appreciate", "feel comfortable")
  - 3: Partially measurable (some criteria given)
  - 5: Completely measurable (specific success criteria)

- [ ] **Action Verbs:** Are appropriate cognitive-level verbs used?
  - 1: No action verbs or very vague
  - 3: Some action verbs but wrong cognitive level
  - 5: Clear action verbs matched to appropriate cognitive level

- [ ] **Achievability:** Is the objective realistic given prerequisites?
  - 1: Unrealistic knowledge jump
  - 3: Challenging but possible
  - 5: Well-scaffolded and achievable

- [ ] **Relevance:** Does it support business/technical goals?
  - 1: Not clearly connected to outcomes
  - 3: Somewhat relevant
  - 5: Directly supports stated outcomes

**Overall Quality Score:** [Sum of ratings / 25 * 10] = X/10

## 📚 **STEP 2: BLOOM'S TAXONOMY CLASSIFICATION**

### **Cognitive Level Identification**

**For Each Learning Objective, Identify the Target Cognitive Level:**

#### **Level 1: REMEMBER (Recall Facts)**
- **Action Verbs:** Define, identify, list, name, recall, recognize, state
- **Example:** "Define AI, ML, and LLM in business terms"
- **Assessment:** Multiple choice, matching, fill-in-the-blank

#### **Level 2: UNDERSTAND (Explain Concepts)**  
- **Action Verbs:** Describe, explain, paraphrase, summarize, interpret
- **Example:** "Explain how AI creates business value in manufacturing"
- **Assessment:** Short answer, concept mapping, explanation tasks

#### **Level 3: APPLY (Use Knowledge)**
- **Action Verbs:** Apply, execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate
- **Example:** "Use ChatGPT to create a quality control checklist"
- **Assessment:** Practical exercises, simulations, hands-on tasks

#### **Level 4: ANALYZE (Break Down Problems)**
- **Action Verbs:** Analyze, compare, contrast, examine, break down
- **Example:** "Compare three AI tools for inventory management effectiveness"
- **Assessment:** Case studies, comparative analysis, troubleshooting

#### **Level 5: EVALUATE (Make Judgments)**
- **Action Verbs:** Evaluate, judge, critique, assess, justify, defend
- **Example:** "Evaluate AI vendor proposals using ROI criteria"
- **Assessment:** Critiques, evaluations, recommendation reports

#### **Level 6: CREATE (Produce Original Work)**
- **Action Verbs:** Create, design, develop, formulate, plan, produce
- **Example:** "Design an AI implementation plan for your facility"
- **Assessment:** Projects, presentations, original solutions

### **Classification Template:**
```
CURRENT OBJECTIVE: "[Current text]"
COGNITIVE LEVEL: [Level 1-6 from above]
EVIDENCE: [Why you classified it this way]
APPROPRIATE LEVEL?: [Yes/No - should it be this level for this audience?]
RECOMMENDED LEVEL: [What level should it actually be?]
```

## 🔍 **STEP 3: PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE MAPPING**

### **Knowledge Dependency Analysis**

#### **3A. Explicit Prerequisites (What We Say They Need)**
```
PREREQUISITE ANALYSIS TEMPLATE:
==============================
MODULE: [Module Name]

EXPLICIT PREREQUISITES (Currently Listed):
├── [What the module page says they need]
├── [Any prerequisite modules mentioned]
└── [Any skills/knowledge explicitly stated]

VALIDATION:
├── Are these actually taught in prerequisite modules? [Yes/No]
├── Are they sufficient for this module's objectives? [Yes/No]
└── What's missing from explicit prerequisites? [List gaps]
```

#### **3B. Implicit Prerequisites (What We Assume They Know)**
**For each learning objective, ask:**
1. **What knowledge must learners already have to achieve this objective?**
2. **What skills are assumed but not explicitly taught?**
3. **What cognitive abilities does this require?**

```
IMPLICIT PREREQUISITE TEMPLATE:
==============================
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: "[Specific objective]"

TO ACHIEVE THIS, LEARNERS MUST ALREADY KNOW:
├── Concepts: [What ideas/terminology they need to understand]
├── Skills: [What they need to be able to do]
├── Tools: [What software/platforms they need familiarity with]
├── Context: [What business/technical background is assumed]
└── Cognitive Patterns: [What thinking skills are required]

TAUGHT ELSEWHERE?: [Yes/No - where are these prerequisites covered?]
KNOWLEDGE GAP?: [Yes/No - are there untaught prerequisites?]
```

#### **3C. Missing Prerequisites (Knowledge Gaps)**
```
GAP ANALYSIS TEMPLATE:
=====================
MODULE: [Module Name]

CRITICAL GAPS (Must be taught before this module):
├── [Concepts needed but not taught anywhere]
├── [Skills needed but not taught anywhere]
└── [Tools/platforms not introduced elsewhere]

MODERATE GAPS (Would help but not essential):
├── [Nice-to-have background knowledge]
├── [Supportive concepts that could be just-in-time]
└── [Advanced applications that could be optional]

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
├── Risk of Confusion: [High/Medium/Low]
├── Risk of Dropout: [High/Medium/Low]
└── Risk of Failure: [High/Medium/Low]
```

## ✍️ **STEP 4: SMART OBJECTIVE REWRITING**

### **SMART Criteria Framework**

#### **4A. SMART Template Structure**
```
REWRITTEN OBJECTIVE TEMPLATE:
============================
"By completing this module, you will be able to:"

├── [SPECIFIC ACTION VERB] + [WHAT] + [HOW WELL/CONTEXT] (Bloom's Level: X)
├── [SPECIFIC ACTION VERB] + [WHAT] + [HOW WELL/CONTEXT] (Bloom's Level: X)  
├── [SPECIFIC ACTION VERB] + [WHAT] + [HOW WELL/CONTEXT] (Bloom's Level: X)
└── [SPECIFIC ACTION VERB] + [WHAT] + [HOW WELL/CONTEXT] (Bloom's Level: X)

ASSESSMENT METHODS:
├── Knowledge Check: [How will you verify they know concepts?]
├── Skill Application: [How will you verify they can apply skills?]
├── Quality Criteria: [What defines successful completion?]
└── Time Expectation: [How long should this take?]
```

#### **4B. Action Verb Selection Guide**

**Choose verbs that match the intended cognitive level:**

```
REMEMBER: define, identify, list, match, name, recall, select, state
UNDERSTAND: classify, describe, discuss, explain, express, locate, report, translate
APPLY: choose, demonstrate, employ, illustrate, implement, operate, practice, use
ANALYZE: appraise, break down, compare, contrast, differentiate, examine, test
EVALUATE: argue, assess, critique, defend, estimate, judge, predict, support
CREATE: assemble, construct, design, develop, formulate, investigate, produce
```

#### **4C. Quality Check Criteria**

**Each rewritten objective must:**
- [ ] Start with a specific action verb
- [ ] Specify what the learner will do (the action)
- [ ] Include context or conditions
- [ ] Have measurable criteria for success
- [ ] Be achievable given prerequisites
- [ ] Support overall module/course goals
- [ ] Be time-bounded (completion timeframe)
