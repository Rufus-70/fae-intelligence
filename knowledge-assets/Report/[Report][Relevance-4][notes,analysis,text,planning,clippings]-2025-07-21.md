Most people think staff scheduling at a supermarket is a matter of simple math: match the number of employees to the expected number of customers, and the job’s done. But in Japan, where a passing typhoon, a surprise festival, or even the day’s horoscope can alter shopping patterns in a heartbeat, workforce planning is anything but predictable.

For one of the country’s largest supermarket chains, managing shifts for over 10,000 employees across hundreds of stores was a constant challenge. Static schedules and manual adjustments resulted in high labor costs and low employee morale. The goal was to have the right people in the right place, at the right time, while keeping staff motivated and balanced.

To tackle this, the company turned to AI-powered workforce management, aiming not just to automate schedules but to intelligently adapt them to real-world conditions, in advance, in real-time, and in tune with both business needs and human expectations.

## Client’s Requirement

Before implementing a new system, the supermarket relied on manual or semi-automated methods to manage employee schedules. This traditional approach presented several limitations:

- Inability to accurately predict customer traffic, on a day-to-day or even hour-by-hour basis, resulting in overstaffing during quiet periods and understaffing during peak hours.
- Escalating labor costs, driven by excessive staffing levels and unplanned overtime.
- Rigid and impersonal scheduling, which failed to consider individual employee performance, working capacity, and personal preferences, led to job dissatisfaction and increased turnover.
- Difficulty in controlling working hours limits, posing risks of labor law violations, and affecting employee well-being.

## VTI’s AI Solution for Staff Scheduling

Faced with the supermarket’s growing workforce management challenges, VTI partnered closely with the customer to fully understand the complexities behind their scheduling issues. Through a series of operational audits, data reviews, and consultations with store managers and HR teams, VTI identified the critical factors impacting staff scheduling efficiency, from unpredictable customer footfall to a lack of personalized scheduling for employees.

With these insights, VTI developed and deployed a customized AI-driven shift management system tailored to the supermarket’s unique business environment. The system uses sophisticated demand forecasting models that combine historical sales trends, live weather data, and local event calendars to accurately predict customer traffic for each store and time slot.

![staff-scheduling-system-architecture](https://vti.com.vn/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/%E3%83%AA%E3%83%86%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB%E3%81%ABAI%E3%83%BBDataAnalysis%E6%B4%BB%E7%94%A8%E4%BA%8B%E4%BE%8B.pptx.jpg.webp)

Using these forecasts, the AI continuously optimizes staffing levels in real-time, ensuring that each store has the right number of employees on hand, neither overstaffed nor understaffed at any given moment.

To complete the solution, VTI integrated the system with the supermarket’s existing attendance management and payroll systems, creating a fully automated, seamless workflow, from intelligent shift creation to attendance tracking and payroll processing.
