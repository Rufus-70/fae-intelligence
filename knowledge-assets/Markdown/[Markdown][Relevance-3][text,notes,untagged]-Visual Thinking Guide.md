## 1. Excalidraw: Your Digital Whiteboard

Excalidraw is for free-form thinking, brainstorming, and connecting ideas visually.

### Your First Drawing: Mapping Fae Intelligence

1.  **Open the Command Palette:** Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on Mac).
2.  **Create a New Drawing:** Type `Excalidraw: Create new drawing` and press Enter. Choose a file name like `Fae Intelligence Overview`.
3.  **Start Mapping:**
    *   Use the **Rectangle** tool to create a box for each major component of your project (e.g., "Fae Intelligence Hub", "Consultancy Dashboard", "RAG System", "n8n Workflows").
    *   Use the **Arrow** tool to draw connections between them.
    *   Use the **Text** tool to label everything.
4.  **Link to Notes:** Select a shape (like your "Consultancy Dashboard" box), right-click, and choose "Link to file...". Start typing `consultancy-dashboard` to link directly to that note or folder.

This gives you a high-level, interactive diagram of your entire project.

## 2. Lovely-Mindmap: Structured Outlining

Lovely-Mindmap turns your outlines into clean, hierarchical mind maps automatically.

### Your First Mind Map: Visualizing This Guide

1.  **Open the Command Palette:** Press `Ctrl+P`.
2.  **Activate the Mind Map View:** Type `Lovely Mindmap: Open Mindmap` and press Enter. This will open a new pane.
3.  **Create an Outline:** In a new note, or right here in this one, create a bulleted list like this:

    ```markdown
    - Main Idea
        - Sub-topic A
            - Detail 1
            - Detail 2
        - Sub-topic B
    ```
4.  **View the Mind Map:** As you type the list, you will see it automatically rendered as a mind map in the Lovely-Mindmap pane.

This is perfect for taking a structured document or a set of meeting notes and quickly seeing the hierarchy of ideas.
