# BMAD Full Execution Status Tracker

Last updated: {today}

## Scope
Tracks execution readiness and actions across Fae Intelligenceâ€™s 12 systems [[memory:5632863]].

## Status by System
- 1) Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)
  - Status: Partially ready (client/scripts present: `knowledge-integration/services/neo4j-client.ts`, `neo/ingest_neo4j.py`)
  - Next: Ensure Neo4j running; set `.env` creds; run `neo/ingest_neo4j.py` on sample + vault extracts
- 2) Obsidian Knowledge Vault
  - Status: External app; content present in repo under `knowledge-assets/`
  - Next: Link vault path in launch docs; optional
- 3) RAG Service
  - Status: Not detected in this workspace
  - Next: Bring `fae-intelligence-rag` service into monorepo or disable for now
- 4) Consultancy Dashboard (React)
  - Status: Present in `consultancy-dashboard/` (will be launched on :5173)
  - Next: Install deps; run dev server; connect to blog/editor links
- 5) Notion Backend Integration
  - Status: Present in `notion-dashboard-backend/`
  - Next: Configure env; run `node index.js`; wire to dashboard as needed
- 6) n8n Automation Platform
  - Status: Not configured in repo
  - Next: Add docker-compose and basic flows or defer
- 7) Next.js Web Platform
  - Status: App code in `src/app/` but no root `package.json` detected
  - Next: Confirm build system or consolidate into a single app
- 8) Visual Content Editors (ports 8085/8086)
  - Status: Present under `public/visual-editor/` and `html-blog/`
  - Next: Serve static on :8085 (editor) and :8086 (blog)
- 9) Blog Management System (Static/JS)
  - Status: Present in `html-blog/` with build scripts
  - Next: Serve statically for now; integrate publishing later
- 10) Firebase Integration
  - Status: Sample pages present; env not verified
  - Next: Add `.env.local` and verify rules
- 11) Development Tools
  - Status: Tool hub script present (`fae-tools-complete.sh`) with host paths
  - Next: Create container-safe variants
- 12) BMAD Framework
  - Status: Agent bundles present under `BMAD/web-bundles`
  - Next: Use orchestrator and role agents to drive sprint planning

## Integration Highlights
- Blog + Visual Editor: Integrated docs indicate dashboard/editor linkage and flows (`DASHBOARD_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`).

## Immediate Actions
- [ ] Start consultancy dashboard (:5173)
- [ ] Serve visual editor (:8085)
- [ ] Serve static blog (:8086)
- [ ] Verify Neo4j connectivity and sample ingest
- [ ] Decide RAG service scope for this phase

## Risks/Assumptions
- Host-specific paths in `fae-tools-complete.sh` are not valid inside this environment
- n8n and RAG not yet provisioned here; tracked for later phase
